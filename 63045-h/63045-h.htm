<span class="ph3">THE BEGINNING OF THE FAIRY TALE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, as the fairy tales have it,
there was a certain country town. It was a
sleepy little town, where few things happened. It
was like a dog grown old and lazy with basking in
the sun, undisturbed by motor-cars and modern
rush. An occasional event like a fly, and as
small and insignificant as that insect, would settle
momentarily upon it. For an instant it would
be roused, shake itself, and promptly go to sleep
again.</p>

<p>The houses in the town were all alike&mdash;small,
detached, and built of red brick. They were named
after the shrubs and trees that grew in their gardens.
There was the Myrtles, the Hawthorns, the Laurels,
the Yews, the Poplars, and many others.</p>

<p>One May morning, when the flowers on the
laburnum trees were hanging in a shower of golden
rain, and the pink and white blossoms of the hawthorn
bushes were filling the air with a sweet and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>sickly scent, a single cab, drawn by a horse as sleepy
as the town to which it belonged, drove up the
small, clean street, and turned in at the gate marked
the Poplars.</p>

<p>Two small children with satchels on their backs
paused to peep up the drive. They saw two black
boxes being hoisted by the driver on to the roof of
the cab. There was nothing, one would think, of
vital interest in the sight, but it proved more attractive
than the thought of lesson books and school-room
benches. They remained to gaze.</p>

<p>In a couple of moments a woman came through
the front door. She was clad in a black cashmere
dress of ample folds, partly hidden by a blade satin
jacket, with large, loose sleeves. A wide, white
linen collar adorned with a small black velvet bow
surrounded her neck; a mushroom-shaped hat, also
black, was tied by broad strings beneath her chin.
In one hand she held a large and tightly rolled umbrella,
in the other was a black satin bag drawn up
by a cord. It bulged in a knobby fashion. It had
evidently been stuffed to the extent of its capacities.</p>

<p>The woman spoke to the driver, then got into the
cab. He climbed to the box, flicked his whip, turned
the horse&rsquo;s head, and drove once again through the
gate.</p>

<p>The children scuttled to one side, and the cab
drove up the street.</p>

<p>Its occupant sat upright within it, clutching tightly
at the umbrella and the black satin bag. Little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>thrills of happiness were running through her. The
May wind blowing through the window fanned her
face, bringing with it great puffs of scent from the
hawthorn bushes. Sunshine sparkled on the roofs
of the houses, birds were singing in the gardens past
which she drove. It was a day alive with gladness,
warm with the breath of spring, fresh with the sense
of youth. And the woman within the cab, whose
heart, in spite of her sixty years, was as young as
the heart of a child, participated in the gladness.</p>

<p>She watched the people in the streets walking
leisurely in the sunshine. She saw the shops with
the tradesmen standing idle in the doorways. At
the fishmonger&rsquo;s only there was a little air of bustle,
where a maid in a neat print had run in to buy
a couple of soles for lunch.</p>

<p>The woman pulled out her watch&mdash;a huge
affair in solid gold, attached to a black hair
chain. For a moment she glanced at it anxiously,
then returned it to its place with a little sigh of
relief. The horse still trotted on its slow unhurried
way. More shops were passed, then more
houses. Finally the cab drew up with a little
jerk.</p>

<p>The driver got down and opened the cab door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, ma&rsquo;am; and twenty minutes to
spare. I&rsquo;ll call a porter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the boxes were being taken from the cab
Miss Mason opened the black satin bag. From it
she extracted a ten-shilling piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The boxes were wheeled towards the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no change, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the cabby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Miss Mason hurriedly.</p>

<p>The cabby stared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Miss Mason again.</p>

<p>Ten shillings was a small amount to give a man
who had driven her a mile towards happiness. She
followed the porter on to the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victoria, second class,&rdquo; she said to the man at
the ticket office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return or single, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Single,&rdquo; said Miss Mason firmly.</p>

<p>She took the little piece of cardboard from him
and thrust it up her glove. She loved the feeling
of it. It was her passport to freedom.</p>

<p>She watched the boxes being labelled. They
were new boxes and hitherto guiltless of station
labels. When she had seen them firmly attached,
and had been solemnly assured by the porter that
the paste was both strong and adhesive, she turned
her attention to the bookstall. After a few moments&rsquo;
survey she moved away hurriedly. The
pictures on the covers of some of the books distressed
her, especially one of a young female with
red hair and very insufficient orange attire. For
a moment Miss Mason blushed. But she forgot
the objectionable book in looking along the shiny
rails in the direction from which the train must
arrive.</p>

<p>The sudden ringing of a bell made her jump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Train&rsquo;s signalled, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the porter.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here in five minutes now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure and put in my boxes,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, ma&rsquo;am. Corner seat facing the engine,
did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes; a seat somewhere,&rdquo; stammered Miss
Mason. The near approach of the train was making
her feel nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll see to it. Second class I think
you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a distant whistle; next, the panting
as of some great beast, and an engine with its tail
of carriages steamed into sight. It drew up
slowly at the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, ma&rsquo;am. Carriage all to yourself.
Boxes will be in the front part of the train.
Thank you kindly, ma&rsquo;am. Anything I can get
for you? Paper or anything? Window up or
down? Will put in the boxes myself. Good
morning, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tip proportionate to the fare Miss Mason had
paid the cabby was responsible for this burst of
eloquence.</p>

<p>In spite of the porter&rsquo;s assurance that he would
see to the boxes himself, Miss Mason stood with
her head through the carriage window till she had
seen them actually deposited in the guard&rsquo;s van.
Then she sat down in the corner of the carriage.</p>

<p>The porter reappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in, ma&rsquo;am. You&rsquo;re off now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gentle vibration through the train,
and the platform began to recede. The one woman
left on it&mdash;a stout woman who had been seeing
her daughter off on her way to service&mdash;waved
a large white pocket-handkerchief. Its fluttering
was the last thing Miss Mason saw as the train left
the station.</p>

<p>She heaved a little sigh.</p>

<p>She found she was still clutching the large umbrella.
She laid it now upon the seat beside her.
She was almost too excited to think of the happiness
before her. She hardly wanted to do so. It
was almost too overpowering. She would realize
it by degrees. At the moment there were a thousand
trivial delights around her.</p>

<p>She examined the carriage in which she was
seated. The number on the door was seven
hundred and seventy-seven. Miss Mason had a
secret partiality for certain numbers, seven being
her favourite. She was seven years old when she
had her first silk frock. It was a blue and white
check frock, and her hair&mdash;Miss Mason at that
time wore it in two plaits&mdash;had been tied with
blue ribbons. Seventeen had been, up to date, the
happiest year of her life. But more of that year
anon. At twenty-seven she had been allowed
the entrance of Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s library. At
thirty-seven she had become the owner of a
kitten. At forty-seven Miss Stanhope had given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>her the watch she now wore. At fifty-seven a
favourite rose-tree had borne the most perfect
flowers. Trivial enough facts to form landmarks
in a life, yet they formed landmarks in Miss Mason&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>She again looked approvingly at the number.
From it she turned to a contemplation of the
photographs which adorned the walls. They were
the usual kind of photographs found in railway
carriages&mdash;seaside promenades, ruined castles,
lakes with mountains beyond. Miss Mason read
the names below them with interest. She looked
at the gas-globe in the roof of the carriage, with
its black cover which could be drawn over it if
the passengers found the light troublesome. She
looked at the emergency cord which was to be
pulled down to attract the attention of the guard
in case of accident. She noted that the penalty
for its improper use was five pounds. It seemed
to Miss Mason a large sum to pay merely for
pulling a little piece of string. She wondered if
anyone had ever been bold enough to pull it without
necessity.</p>

<p>After gazing at it for two minutes with a certain
amount of awe, she put her arm through the
padded loop by the window, and looked out at the
scenery past which they were flying.</p>

<p>There were fields in which sheep and cows were
solemnly munching the fresh grass; there were
hedges covered with the fairy snow of the haw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>thorn
blossoms; there were woods of larches, oaks,
and beeches, and among them the darker green of
firs; there were streams rippling golden-brown past
meadow banks and clumps of rushes; there were
children swinging on gates and waving cap or
handkerchief as the train rushed by. She saw
market carts and occasionally a dogcart on roads
running by the railway, and now and then a solitary
cyclist, all going at a snail&rsquo;s pace so it seemed
compared with the rate at which she herself was
travelling. They passed houses with trimly-kept
gardens alive with flowers; cottages with strips of
vegetable gardens where from lines attached to
posts stuck among the cabbages washing was hung
out to dry. The May breeze swung the clothing
to and fro, ballooning it momentarily to ridiculous
shapes, fluttering red petticoats, white tablecloths,
and blue blouses, like the waving of coloured
flags.</p>

<p>Again the joyous note of youth and gladness
sounded in Miss Mason&rsquo;s heart. She gave a queer
little gruff laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Like the fairy
tales I used to read when I was little. Now I&rsquo;m
part of the fairy tale. Can hardly believe it.
Yet it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">ANCIENT HISTORY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>UTWARDLY Miss Mason was not unlike
certain pictures of the fairy godmother who
escorted Cinderella to the ball. Being a fairy
godmother, no doubt that old lady&rsquo;s heart was every
bit as young as Miss Mason&rsquo;s, so the similarity may
very likely have extended still further.</p>

<p>Of the fairy godmother&rsquo;s previous history there
is no known record. Miss Mason&rsquo;s history was
the public property of the little town in which she
lived. It is not unduly lengthy. It also cannot be
termed exciting.</p>

<p>Miss Mason became an orphan at the age of five.
Her mother had been a pretty Irish girl, only
daughter of a penniless Irish gentleman; and not
having had enough of poverty in her own home,
she gave her heart to one, Dick Mason, a struggling
painter, who was as ugly as he was gay and light-hearted.
In spite of poverty she had seven years
of such happiness as falls to the lot of few women.
Then Dick was killed riding a friend&rsquo;s young
unbroken mare, and a month later his wife followed him;
dying&mdash;if such a complaint truly exists&mdash;of
a broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Their one child, Olive, was left penniless, and
with only one relation in the world&mdash;a Miss
Stanhope, a wealthy and eccentric cousin of her
father&rsquo;s, who was at this time a maiden lady of
thirty.</p>

<p>A sense of duty as stern and uncompromising
as Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s own appearance induced her
to offer the child a home. Duty also prompted
her to look well after her physical welfare, and
educate her in a style befitting a young woman
of gentle birth. Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s views on education
were decided and not at all involved. Every
lady, she averred, should be able to speak French
fluently, make her own underclothes, and be
conversant with the writings of the best authors.
Music&mdash;which she disliked&mdash;was left outside the
category. She provided the child with a French
governess, who was a beautiful needlewoman.
The introduction to the authors would come later.</p>

<p>Olive remained under Madame Dupont&rsquo;s tuition
for twelve years. When she was seventeen she
was sent to &ldquo;finish her education&rdquo; at Miss
Talbot&rsquo;s select Academy for Young Ladies at
Brighton. This year was the happiest in Olive&rsquo;s
life. Not only was there a daily walk on the
esplanade, from whence she gazed for the first
time in her life at the marvel of the sea, but also
she was permitted to take drawing-lessons. She
had inherited three things from her father, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>first being his plainness of feature, the second his
youthful heart, and the third his passion for
drawing.</p>

<p>An extremely inefficient but well-meaning young
man of impeachable character visited Miss Talbot&rsquo;s
Academy for Young Ladies twice a week,
and instructed the pupils in this art. Chalk
drawings from casts were the style in vogue. It
was considered an extremely advanced style. The
chalk was kept in small glass tubes, it was shaken
on to a pad, and applied to the paper with leather
stumps, in the manner known as stippling. The
poverty of the instruction, the horribly inartistic
results produced, were unrecognized by Miss Mason.
Chalk representations of plaster pears, apples,
and floreate designs were produced by her at the
rate of one a fortnight, and were laid carefully
away in a large portfolio with tissue paper between
to keep the chalk from rubbing.</p>

<p>Among the pupils at Miss Talbot&rsquo;s Academy
had been a girl&mdash;one Peggy O&rsquo;Hea. Her father
was a portrait painter of some note. Miss Talbot
had hesitated at introducing this girl; daughter
of a Bohemian&mdash;all artists were Bohemian in
Miss Talbot&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;into her select establishment,
but the fact that her father was a yearly
exhibitor at that most respectable institution the
Royal Academy, and that her uncle was a Dean,
induced Miss Talbot to overlook Bohemia. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>kept, however, a strict guard over Miss O&rsquo;Hea&rsquo;s
conversation with the other pupils, a guard Peggy
invariably evaded; and curled up on her bed in
her nightdress, her arms clasped round her knees,
she would hold forth in glowing terms regarding
her father&rsquo;s studio and the artists who frequented
it. She had in her secret heart a distinct contempt
for the chalk drawings; but she was a generous little
soul, and refrained from putting her thoughts
into words.</p>

<p>From her glowing descriptions, the word studio
came to sound in Miss Mason&rsquo;s ears with a note
akin to magic, while no one guessed the dreams
of art and artists, of the mad sweet land of
Bohemia, cherished by the ugly girl who was
known in the school as &ldquo;that awkward Olive Mason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the year Miss Mason returned
home, to find her presence almost hourly required
by Miss Stanhope, who had developed into what
is usually termed a <i>malade imaginaire</i>. Her only
recreations were gardening, and later&mdash;when at
the age of twenty-seven she was allowed free access
to the library&mdash;reading. In these two occupations
she was able to forget the monotony of
the days.</p>

<p>Children who peeped through the gate on sunny
mornings saw a small shrunken woman with a
thin peevish face sitting on the lawn or in the
veranda, according to the season, while Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>Mason was busy in the flower-beds, her grey dress
tucked up over a black and white striped petticoat,
goloshes on her feet, a large black hat tied
on her head, and gauntlet gloves covering her
hands. The progress of fashion being outside the
strictly limited circle of Miss Mason&rsquo;s life, she had
adopted a costume of her own device, which costume
she found both warm and comfortable, and
it never varied.</p>

<p>The children who peeped through the gate grew
to be men and women; their children peeped in
like fashion, and still the same order of things
endured at the house named the Poplars.</p>

<p>During these years Miss Mason made one
friend. It was curious, though perhaps not out of
keeping with Miss Mason&rsquo;s character, which was
now almost as original as the garments she wore,
that the friend should be a child of ten years old.
She had come to live with her parents at the small
town in which Miss Stanhope resided. The child&rsquo;s
paternal grandmother had been a friend of Miss
Stanhope&rsquo;s youth. That statement in itself had
a flavour of respectability about it. Armed with
a letter of introduction from the grandmother&mdash;Mrs.
Quarly&mdash;the parents ventured to call upon
Miss Stanhope. She received them graciously
enough, and a week later Miss Mason was ordered
to return the visit.</p>

<p>It was then that she met little Sybil Quarly,
who promptly took an unaccountable, but very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>strong, liking to her. In a short time Sybil
learnt which were the hours spent by Miss Mason
in the garden, and from that moment those hours
saw a fair-haired child in short petticoats busy
in the flower-beds with her. To an onlooker Miss
Mason&rsquo;s manner would have appeared almost
surly, but Sybil, with the infallible instinct of
childhood, recognized the tenderness beneath the
gruff exterior. The two became fast friends.</p>

<p>For seven years Sybil helped Miss Mason pull
up weeds, destroy slugs, bud roses, and take
cuttings of carnations. She called her &ldquo;Granny,&rdquo;
and she confided all her childish woes and griefs
to her. Her parents were conventional people,
also they were somewhat strict and unsympathetic.
They did not in the least understand Sybil&rsquo;s timid
nature. Miss Mason saw, to her sorrow, that the
child was being driven to subterfuge and petty untruth
by an overharsh system of treatment. But
she was powerless to do anything. Mrs. Quarly
would have resented the smallest interference. For
seven years Miss Mason gave the child all the tenderness
at her disposal. At the end of that time
Sybil&rsquo;s parents left the little town and took her to
Pangbourne.</p>

<p>During the next three or four years Sybil and
Miss Mason kept up a fitful correspondence.
From much that the girl left unsaid Miss Mason
felt that she was not happy. Had she herself been
gifted with the pen of a ready writer, she might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>indirectly have sought the girl&rsquo;s confidence, but
neither written nor spoken words came easily to
her. There were times&mdash;and those when she
most longed for the power of speech&mdash;when she
felt herself possessed of a dumb dog. She wrote
and told Sybil that the roses were in bloom, that
she had pickled a hundred and fifty slugs in salt
and water after one shower of rain, that the
Shirley poppies they had planted one year were
spreading like weeds over the garden. She heard
from Sybil that she had made a few new friends,
among them one, Cecily Mainwaring, who lived in
London, and that she stayed with her occasionally.
Her letters, however, gave mere facts;
there was no hint as to her thoughts, or whether
she were happy in her new surroundings. And
Miss Mason longed to ask her, yet all the time she
could write of nothing but pickled slugs and the
blight on rose-trees. And after four years Sybil&rsquo;s
letters suddenly ceased. Miss Mason wrote three
times and received no answer. Then she, too,
stopped writing. And thus the years, as far as
Miss Mason was concerned, rolled on.</p>

<p>But, at last, one sunny morning when a boy
and girl approached the gate they saw no one in
the garden, and the blinds in the house pulled
down. Old Miss Stanhope had died quietly in
her sleep that morning, and after forty-three years
Miss Mason had deserted the flower-beds. She
was sitting in the desolate drawing-room, unable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>yet to grasp the meaning of the one really important
event which had occurred in her life since she was
five years old.</p>

<p>Four days later Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s will was read.
Miss Mason had been left sole heiress to an income
which amounted to something like fifteen
thousand a year. No one but Miss Stanhope herself
and her trustees had had the smallest conception
of her wealth. The terms of the will, which appeared
in the local papers, had the effect of taking
every one&rsquo;s breath away.</p>

<p>Miss Mason spoke to the lawyer regarding it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t spend anything like that amount a
year,&rdquo; she said gruffly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how Miss
Stanhope managed to. Much rather you gave me
one thousand and looked after the rest. Shan&rsquo;t
find it easy to spend one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Davis stared for a moment. Then he suddenly
realized&mdash;and by a marvellous leap of intelligence
on his part&mdash;that Miss Mason was under
the impression that he would yearly press fifteen
thousand sovereigns into her palm. The question
of banks and cheque-books had not presented itself
to her mind.</p>

<p>During the next half-hour Henry Davis found
himself explaining matters to Miss Mason much
as he would have explained them to a child of
twelve. Miss Mason grasped the situation instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then before you go you&rsquo;d better show me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>how to draw a cheque,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Think that
was your expression. I&rsquo;m not imbecile, though
when a woman of sixty doesn&rsquo;t know the first principles
of banks and cheque-books you might think
she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was after Mr. Davis had left that Miss Mason
gradually began to realize what Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s
death and her newly-acquired wealth would mean.
She had lived so long in one groove that the possibility
of change had never actually occurred to
her. At first she had felt almost stunned. But
suddenly, in a flash, she saw a new life before
her. Every dream of her seventeenth year could
be fulfilled. It found expression in one short sentence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall go to London and take a studio.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE LADY OF THE BLUE DRESS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ISS Mason was sitting in the lounge of
the Wilton Hotel. Mr. Davis&mdash;the lawyer&mdash;had
given her the name of this hotel, telling
her that it was both quiet and comfortable.</p>

<p>A tiny cloud had arisen in Miss Mason&rsquo;s mind.
It partially eclipsed the sunshine of her morning
mood. She knew vaguely what had caused it.</p>

<p>She had changed her dress on her arrival, donning
a black satin gown made in precisely the same
style as the cashmere. A lace collar took the place
of the linen one. A cameo brooch, large, and set
in gold as massive as her watch, superseded the
black bow. Miss Mason never wore jewellery except
in the evening.</p>

<p>She had dined excellently at a small table in a
room adorned with water-colour drawings. Between
the courses she had found herself admiring
them. She was so intent on them that at first
she did not notice the covert smiles which two
girls were directing towards her table. When she
did, the smiles began to make her feel uncomfortable.
At first she wondered if her cap were
crooked, or her brooch unpinned, but gradually it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>dawned on her that it was just she herself who was
affording them amusement.</p>

<p>Miss Mason had finished the last morsels of
her gooseberry tart hurriedly, had swallowed her
glass of light wine, and gone out into the lounge.
She told herself that she was an old fool to worry
over the little incident, but it had caused a vague
anxiety in her mind.</p>

<p>She took up a number of the &ldquo;Graphic&rdquo; and
began turning the pages. The style of the advertisements
displayed within its covers had made
her previously imagine the periodical to be exclusively
intended for feminine perusal. She had
been slightly alarmed before dinner to see a stout
elderly gentleman studying it profoundly. A momentary
idea took possession of her as to whether
it was not her duty to go up to him and warn
him regarding the nature of some of the contents,
but as she saw it was the middle of the book he
was studying, she concluded that someone had already
given him a delicate hint regarding the advertisement
pages. All the same, she could not
imagine the editor of the paper to be a modest
man.</p>

<p>One or two people had come into the lounge
for coffee after dinner, but they had left it again,
and, at the moment, it was deserted save for Miss
Mason and one other woman.</p>

<p>There was something about the woman that
attracted her attention. It was not merely her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>beauty, but something in the graceful way in
which she was sitting in her chair, and in her
manner of speaking to the waiter who brought
her coffee. Miss Mason found herself watching
her. She liked the ivory whiteness of her skin,
the vivid red-brown of her hair, and the expression
in her eyes. Her dress, too, which was a
curious deep blue, pleased her immensely.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman looked up. She saw Miss
Mason&rsquo;s eyes fixed on her, and she smiled. There
was something so frank and spontaneous about
the smile that Miss Mason found herself smiling
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have the place to ourselves,&rdquo; said the
woman. &ldquo;Every one else has departed for
different theatres. I should have gone myself
if I hadn&rsquo;t an appointment with a friend of
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never been to a theatre in my life,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason. &ldquo;Lack of opportunity, not prejudice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you really care to have the opportunity it
is certain to present itself sooner or later,&rdquo; replied
the woman calmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a question of the
intensity of wishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason leant a little forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the opportunity sometimes arrive too
late?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question was put almost involuntarily.
It was one she had been asking herself for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>last three-quarters of an hour&mdash;ever since her
somewhat hurried exit from the dining-room; and
the question did not refer merely to the opportunity
of visiting the theatre. The woman understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That raises rather a fine point of question,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;Can it be fairly said that one has
been given the opportunity if it is truly impossible
to accept it, which I imagine &lsquo;too late&rsquo; would signify?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason did not reply at once. She wanted
to tell this woman about the little cloud which had
covered the brightness of her sun, the insidious
little doubt which had crept into her mind. Yet
she hardly knew how to begin.</p>

<p>The woman waited. She was one of those to
whom confidences are given. If she had said anything
at that moment the sentence Miss Mason
was slowly preparing in her mind would never
have reached her lips. It came suddenly and
jerkily, it was spoken, too, almost below Miss Mason&rsquo;s
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t one ever too old? Have waited a long
time for the chance of happiness. Got it now.
But perhaps I am too old.&rdquo; A slow painful flush
had mounted in Miss Mason&rsquo;s face with the
words.</p>

<p>The younger woman turned quickly towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too old for happiness!&rdquo; she cried, with a
little laugh. &ldquo;Never! If happiness has come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>you, welcome her with both hands; and with
every kiss she gives you years will roll away from
your heart. Happiness is like the spring, which
wakes the world to brightness after a dreary winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason gave a little choke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Felt like that myself in the train this morning.
Forgot I was sixty. Thought it was splendid to
be alive. Was going to enjoy myself. Was so
glad thinking about it thought everybody would
be glad too. Can&rsquo;t explain very well, but felt
quite young. Thought all the young things in the
world would let me watch their happiness, and
I&rsquo;d be happy in my own happiness and theirs.
Didn&rsquo;t want to interfere with them, or try to mix
myself up with them. Just wanted to be a kind
of onlooker. Never thought they&rsquo;d stop to laugh
at me&mdash;make quiet fun of me, I mean. Made me
feel very old. Silly nonsense, of course.
Oughtn&rsquo;t to care. Am old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked up quickly. She had noticed
the little scene in the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Age has nothing to do with the matter,&rdquo;
she replied quietly. &ldquo;There is no reason why
you should not enjoy yourself enormously. The
dullest person I know is a young man of twenty-three,
and one of the gayest is an aunt of mine
who is seventy-five. Happiness is a gift of the
gods, and is bestowed by them irrespective of age.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Then, quite suddenly,
Miss Mason began to tell the woman the story
of her life. She told it badly. For the last forty
years at least Miss Mason had talked little. Miss
Stanhope had never cared to encourage conversation
other than her own. A daily and minute
recital of her own imaginary ailments had sufficed
her. That had been a subject which had never
palled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the summary of it all is,&rdquo; ended Miss
Mason, &ldquo;that my life has been utterly narrow.&rdquo;
She stopped and looked at the woman. There was
something half humorous, half pathetic, in the expression
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the woman slowly, &ldquo;that one
is too ready to use the term &lsquo;narrow&rsquo; for lives
and opinions which have not covered, as we imagine,
a great deal of ground. Sometimes I
think &lsquo;concentrated&rsquo; would be a better word to
use for them. I know that people who have
darted hither and thither from one place to another,
and from one excitement to another, often
talk about &lsquo;living&rsquo; and the broadness of their
lives. But I fancy that if one could go up in a
kind of mental aeroplane and look down upon those
lives, one might see that their grooves, though they
took an intricate pattern, were possibly narrower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>than some of those which have gone along one
straight and monotonous course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Miss Mason again. Then
she smiled half-shamefacedly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing&mdash;in
spite of all the monotony, I&rsquo;ve never
been able to get rid of my belief in kind of
fairy tale happenings. Utterly ridiculous, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman laughed, a low clear laugh, which
pleased Miss Mason enormously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re on ground with which I&rsquo;m far
more familiar,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I was trying to get
hold of words and expressions before which were
rather outside my vocabulary, and I fear I sounded
a little stilted in consequence. But fairy tales!
Why life is a fairy tale. Bad fairies and wicked
magicians get mixed up in it of course, or it
wouldn&rsquo;t be one, but there are good fairies and all
kinds of unexpected and delicious happenings right
through it in spite of them. There&rsquo;s often, too, a
long journey through a wood. You&rsquo;ve been
through yours. What do you hope to find on this
side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A studio,&rdquo; said Miss Mason promptly. This
woman was making it extraordinarily easy for
her to tell her fairy tale. &ldquo;Have wanted one
ever since I was seventeen, and I think almost
before that. Perhaps because my father was an
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ll take one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have come up to look for one,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason. &ldquo;Am going to look at pictures too.
There&rsquo;s the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, and
the Academy. Used to read about them. Later
I shall go abroad. Thought I&rsquo;d better get used
to going about in England first. Have read a lot
about pictures. Used to take in a magazine called
&lsquo;The Studio.&rsquo; Saw it advertised once and sent for
it. Miss Stanhope used to make me a small allowance.
She was kind really, though didn&rsquo;t always
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kindest people don&rsquo;t always understand,&rdquo;
said the younger woman quickly. &ldquo;Are you going
to take an unfurnished studio? and will you have
some of the furniture sent up from your old
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a curious luxury in speaking of the
details of a cherished scheme, and especially to
one who has never before found a sympathetic
audience. This the woman knew when she put the
question.</p>

<p>Miss Mason gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t ask that if you&rsquo;d seen the furniture.
Was so used to it it was a wonder I still went
on thinking it hideous. I think it was after I&rsquo;d
been away from it for a year and came back to
it that I knew how terrible it was. After that
it remained terrible. It will all be sold. Have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>arranged for that. Couldn&rsquo;t stay with it any longer
than was necessary. Don&rsquo;t care what becomes of
it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason was feeling so light-hearted again
she was almost reckless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll buy new things?&rdquo; asked the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Soft colours&mdash;blues and greens. Love
blue. Your dress is lovely.&rdquo; The words were
jerky but genuine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favourite colour,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked in the direction of a mirror
near her. She could see both their figures reflected
in it. Again a little wistful look crept into
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;that it was my
dress those two girls were laughing at. Perhaps
it is queer. Never thought of that before.
Couldn&rsquo;t change now, any more than I could change
my skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped, then looked directly at the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose people will always laugh at me?&rdquo;
she queried. &ldquo;I suppose those girls were right to
laugh. I am queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Then the woman
in the blue dress spoke deliberately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask you a question which may
sound rather conceited,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Which would
you value most&mdash;my opinion or the opinion of
those two girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; said Miss Mason promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am going to tell you exactly what I
think, and you must forgive me if what I say
sounds impertinent. I don&rsquo;t think you are the
least queer. I think you are quaint and original.
Any artist would infinitely prefer your method of
dressing than the method chosen by the older
women of the present day. I think it quite possible
that you will find a few people will laugh at
you, for, as I&rsquo;ve already said, in this fairy tale
world there are bad fairies, and, worse still, stupid
ones. But they don&rsquo;t count, because they aren&rsquo;t
worth consideration, at least not as regards their
opinion of our actions.&rdquo; She spoke the words
slowly and simply, almost as she would have spoken
them to a child.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you take your studio?&rdquo; asked the
woman suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Whistler lived
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conclusive,&rdquo; laughed the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want it to be a nice studio,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Rent won&rsquo;t matter. Miss Stanhope left me
a lot of money. Can&rsquo;t spend it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the fairy tale progresses,&rdquo; said the woman
joyfully. &ldquo;Plenty of money and fairy tale ideas
are the happiest of combinations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad I met you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Feel like I did
when I came up in the train this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our meeting was evidently part of the fairy
tale,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Now I must go and get
my cloak. It&rsquo;s five minutes to nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went towards the stairs. Miss Mason
watched her ascending them.</p>

<p>A moment after she had left, a man came into
the lounge. He was wearing a thin dark grey
overcoat, and held a flat black hat in one hand.
Miss Mason had never before seen an opera hat.
She looked at it with interest. From it she looked
at the man. He was tall and distinctly aristocratic-looking.
Miss Mason noticed that he wore a small
moustache and imperial.</p>

<p>She heard a step on the stairs. The woman in
the blue dress was coming down again. She had
a black satin cloak round her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher, darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is that you?
I&rsquo;m beautifully punctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went up to her and kissed her hand. There
was something charming in the courtliness of his
manner. Miss Mason, who had been momentarily
shocked by the &ldquo;darling,&rdquo; felt it somehow explained
by the subsequent action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment, and I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>She crossed to Miss Mason. The man waited
for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be home till midnight,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m leaving for Italy at an unearthly hour to-mor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>row
morning. But I am sure one day we shall
meet again. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll
enjoy yourself.&rdquo; She longed to say something
more, but the words failed her.</p>

<p>She watched her rejoin the man and leave the
lounge. It seemed extraordinarily empty after her
departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;ll ever lack friends,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason to herself, &ldquo;but if ever she did need
one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She left the rest of the sentence unspoken
in her mind, and finding the place a little
lonely went up to her own room.</p>

<p>It was not till she was in bed that she realized
that she had no idea of the woman&rsquo;s name. It also
never dawned on her to ask the hotel management
for it.</p>

<span class="ph3">THE COURTYARD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>AN Oldfield was standing in front of an
easel on which was a minute canvas. The
scene depicted thereon was a pastoral of Mesonnier-like
detail. At the moment Dan was engaged in
painting lilac flowers on a green and white dress.
The original dress was on a lay figure before him.</p>

<p>The studio in which he was working was one of
seven enclosed in a courtyard. Two of the studios
had small gardens in front. Standing in one of
the gardens it was easier to imagine oneself in the
depths of the country than in the midst of London.
The roll of the traffic in the King&rsquo;s Road was just
sufficiently remote to sound not unlike the roar of
the sea.</p>

<p>There were lilac bushes and laburnums in the
gardens. A thrush sang in one of the laburnum
trees in the spring, and a robin in the winter. The
robin was very tame. It had established a visiting
acquaintance with all seven studios. There was a
certain amount of jealousy among the inhabitants
when occasionally for a week at a time, it would
show a marked preference for one studio. On the
whole its affections were most deeply centred on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>studio number seven. At the moment this studio
was empty.</p>

<p>Dan painted in the lilac flowers carefully, using
extremely small brushes. Every now and then he
stepped back from his work to judge of the effect.
Any onlooker uneducated in the mysteries of art
would have imagined the use of a magnifying glass
a more desirable method to study the effect.
Dan was evidently not of that opinion. He had
just finished painting in the yellow heart of the
thirteenth flower when the sound of the wheels of
some large vehicle entering the courtyard struck
upon his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; he said carelessly, and he
crossed to the window.</p>

<p>A large pantechnicon had drawn up opposite
studio number seven. Men had already run round
to open the doors at the back of the van. It was
full of furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Dan.</p>

<p>He put his palette and brushes down on a table,
and standing on a chair poked his head through the
upper part of the window. A large roll of blue
drugget and a dark oak easel were being carried up
the small garden path. Two men were hauling a
Chesterfield sofa from the van.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Dan again.</p>

<p>He withdrew his head from the window, descended
from the chair, and came out of his studio
into the courtyard. The sunshine, which was brilliant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>shone on his untidy red hair. He looked
like a slightly worried giant.</p>

<p>The Chesterfield was reposing momentarily on
the stones of the courtyard. The men were wiping
their foreheads. The day was warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studio let?&rdquo; demanded Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Bringing in the
furniture, sir. Nice day, but warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s taken the studio?&rdquo; demanded Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t remember the lady&rsquo;s name at the moment,
sir. Elderly lady with grey hair. Saw her
when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old lady!&rdquo; interrupted Dan. His voice
held at least three notes of disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dan had vanished up the garden path of
studio number six, had banged on the door, and entered
without waiting for permission.</p>

<p>A man in his shirtsleeves was standing before
an easel. A nude model was half sitting, half
lying, on the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Barnabas,&rdquo; he began. Then he saw the
model. &ldquo;Morning, Tilly. Sorry I interrupted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the man addressed,
good-humouredly. &ldquo;I thought it was your fairy
footfall before I heard the knock. What&rsquo;s the
trouble? Have you stuck the Messonnier painting
on an envelope in mistake for a postage stamp and
put it in the pillar-box? You&rsquo;d better take a rest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>now, Tilly, while Mr. Oldfield disburdens his
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl stretched herself in a lazy panther-like
fashion, and taking a faded purple dressing-gown
from the model stand flung it round herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studio number seven&rsquo;s let,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; said Barnabas imperturbably.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been vacant six months. It&rsquo;s
a pleasant studio; large, well-ventilated, drains in
perfect condition, an ideal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, Barnabas,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s let
to an old woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old woman,&rdquo; repeated Dan bitterly.</p>

<p>For a moment Barnabas looked utterly taken
aback. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news indeed, my child. For the last five
years at least we&rsquo;ve been a pleasant little coterie
of seven undeniable geniuses all of the male sex.
Then Ashton left us. Why on earth didn&rsquo;t your
friend Shottover take the place? I thought you
said he was going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; replied Dan gloomily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
such a vacillating ass. I told him he&rsquo;d lose it if
he didn&rsquo;t hurry and make up his mind. Now he
has lost it, and we&rsquo;ve an old woman coming to
plant herself among us. It isn&rsquo;t that I dislike
women&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas grinned suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s funny?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your unnecessary statement, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. There was so remarkably little need
to state the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Dan firmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like old
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are exceptions,&rdquo; said Barnabas solemnly.
&ldquo;My paternal grandmother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother your paternal grandmother. I tell you
the studio&rsquo;s let to an old woman, and they&rsquo;re taking
in the furniture now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas moved towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder
what her taste in studio furniture is like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out into his little garden, Dan following
him. A dark oak bookcase and an oak chest were
being removed from the van.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, the ancient lady has got taste!&rdquo; said
Barnabas. &ldquo;Genuine old stuff, or my name&rsquo;s not
John Kirby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two stood together in the garden on the
little gravel path, looking across a bed of forget-me-nots
and a small fence at the working men.</p>

<p>Barnabas&mdash;his real name was John Kirby, but
he had first been nicknamed the Comforter, and
finally Barnabas, the Son of Consolation, by his
fellow-artists&mdash;was a tall man who would have
looked even taller if it had not been for the huge
frame of the man beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that bit of furniture myself,&rdquo;
said Barnabas, as a beautiful corner cupboard was
unearthed from the van. &ldquo;Hullo! what&rsquo;s this?
&lsquo;The Winged Victory,&rsquo; by Jingo! <i>and</i> a pedestal.
Here&rsquo;s art and no mistake. Pictures, too. Here,
you,&rdquo; he called to the two men who were carrying
them, &ldquo;allow us momentarily to cast our eyes upon
those treasures. Ye gods and little fishes! a Nicholson,
a Pryde, two Sickerts, and a genuine Bartolozzi
print. The ancient lady evidently possesses
not only taste but cash&mdash;hard coin of the realm,
my child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those old fogies always have tons of money,&rdquo;
grunted Dan.</p>

<p>Three large wooden packing-cases were now carried
towards the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful with the unpacking of those,&rdquo; said
the man who was evidently the chief in command.
&ldquo;Old blue Worcester dinner service, sir,&rdquo; he explained
in an aside to the two who were looking
over the fence.</p>

<p>Dan groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pure swank on her part,&rdquo; said Barnabas sorrowfully.
&ldquo;What have the fleshpots of Egypt in
common with the earthenware and bread and cheese
of Bohemia. Why didn&rsquo;t she take up her abode
in the fashionable quarters of Kensington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn a Park Lane house into a studio,&rdquo; said
Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea,&rdquo; asked Barnabas, addressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>himself to the man in command, &ldquo;when the
fortunate possessor of these rare and valuable articles
intends to take up her residence in this charming
domicile?&mdash;in other words, when does the
elderly lady come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night, sir, about seven o&rsquo;clock, I think.
Our orders are to have everything ready before six,
even if we had to put on extra hands. But it will
be ready easily, bless you, even to the making of
the beds and final sweeping, which my wife&rsquo;s seeing
to. There&rsquo;s not above four or five hours&rsquo; work
here. There ain&rsquo;t none of the little whatnots and
ornaments to unpack what ladies usually carries
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas looked at Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; he said meaningly. &ldquo;And you
have one of your famous parties on! To-night the
old lady will sleep&mdash;if she can&mdash;lulled by the
sound of hilarious laughter, the twanging of
banjos, ribald songs, and all the other pleasant little
noises which are an invariable accompaniment to
one of your mad entertainments. Shall you be
busy to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; we&rsquo;re moving a family into Elm Park
Gardens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate.
You&rsquo;ll doubtless be required here. The old
lady will be making a hasty exit. The old blue
Worcester dinner service will be repacked less carefully&mdash;there
won&rsquo;t be time for care&mdash;the corner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>cupboard and the Chesterfield sofa, to say nothing
of the Winged&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ass!&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;What is the use of talking
rot about it. We shall have complaints from the
owner of the studios about the noise we make. I
know what it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new set of regulations  la German,&rdquo; said
Barnabas. &ldquo;No pianos before seven or after ten.
Lights out at eleven. We shall become a set of
model young men who will work quietly all the
week and go to church on Sundays. Hullo, here&rsquo;s
Jasper. Let&rsquo;s tell him the pleasing tidings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door of another studio had opened, and a
slight, dark man with a somewhat ascetic and rather
discontented-looking face came out in the sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re studying the preface to a little book
called &lsquo;From Wildness to Decorum,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered
Barnabas gravely. &ldquo;The first chapter will no
doubt be named &lsquo;Hints from the Ancients to
Young Men&mdash;on Deportment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever talk sense?&rdquo; asked Jasper. &ldquo;I
suppose someone has taken this studio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan imparted the information they had lately
received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no more fun for us poor young fellows,
and we&rsquo;ll grow like the good artists grow,&rdquo;
chanted Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should imagine that because
this lady has taken the studio that she should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>necessarily object to any of our amusements,&rdquo; said
Jasper seriously. &ldquo;Besides, I hardly think it is
kind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas gave a little chuckle of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear child!&rdquo; he said patting Jasper gently on
the shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s learnt the first chapter of
the little book by heart while we&rsquo;ve been grizzling
in the garden. Entirely Dan&rsquo;s fault, my child.
He interrupted a busy morning, thereby causing me
to view the whole world, and old ladies in particular,
in a pessimistic spirit. Let us be kind. We
will invite the old dame to your party, Dan. We&rsquo;ll
sing songs suited to the ears of age. We&rsquo;ll hire
a harmonium for the evening, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would occasionally be serious,&rdquo; interrupted
Jasper half impatiently. &ldquo;Of course we
should have preferred a man in the studio, but I
don&rsquo;t see why you and Dan need be so certain that
a woman&rsquo;s advent will interfere with us. Do the
others know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, no, my child,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;It
would take an earthquake to induce the other three
to put nose beyond door or eye to window before
one o&rsquo;clock. If Michael isn&rsquo;t at work on an illustration
of a starved child, he&rsquo;ll be writing an essay
on &lsquo;Humour&mdash;Some more of its more cynical aspects.&rsquo;
Alan will be painting a burning cross in
the centre of a crimson rose, and would regard the
smallest interruption as the highest form of sacrilege,
and Paul will be doing such genuine good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>work that it would be sacrilege to interrupt him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Then Jasper
spoke in the tone of one who has been giving a subject
close consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t think we ought to let the
fact that a woman has taken the studio arouse
feelings of animosity in us towards her. She is
bound to have a studio somewhere if she wants to
paint, and why not among us? I think we should
do our best to make her welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan swore softly beneath his breath. Jasper
had moments of priggishness that were almost beyond
the patience of man to endure. Except when
these moods were on him he was not such a bad
sort of fellow.</p>

<p>Barnabas choked down a little laughter and a
big bit of annoyance at a gulp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right oh! my child. And now I must return
to my studio, or Tilly will have smoked all my
cigarettes. I offered her one once, and henceforth
she has looked upon them all as her own especial
property. Worst of acting in a moment of ill-considered
generosity. Dan, don&rsquo;t be boorish any
longer. I&rsquo;ll leave Jasper to read you a further
homily on the whole duty of man towards ancient
ladies. So long, my children. Don&rsquo;t trample
down my forget-me-nots in your ardour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave them a cheerful nod and vanished
within the studio.</p>

<p>His departure left a curious blank. It gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>something the impression felt when the sun retires
behind a cloud, or the sensation we experience the
first morning of work following a month&rsquo;s holiday.
People almost invariably felt this sensation when
Barnabas left them.</p>

<p>The two other men still stood a few moments
longer watching the unpacking of the van. Dan,
however, had ceased to find the same interest in
the proceedings. He could no longer grumble with
a free mind. In the presence of Jasper his utterances
would have taken on an air of seriousness he
was far from fully intending. Besides, his proximity
in this mood annoyed him. The minute lilac
flowers, too, required his attention.</p>

<p>Jasper remembered that he also had left a model
within his studio. Besides, his latest resolution&mdash;among
others&mdash;was not to waste mornings unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The two separated. The work of removing the
furniture from the van continued.</p>

<p>A thrush, unheeding the presence of the men,
settled in the laburnum tree and began to sing.
Perhaps it was an unconscious song of welcome
to the woman who would that evening enter the
castle of her dreams.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="ph3">IN BOHEMIA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and
through one of the windows of the newly-furnished
studio a shaft of sunlight had found its way.
It formed a patch of light on the blue drugget on
the floor, and caught the corner of an oak dresser
on which the old Worcester dinner service was arranged.</p>

<p>There were two figures in the studio, though to
the eyes of mortals the place would have seemed
empty. The one was in a robe of white and gold,
the other in a dress of dull grey. The white-robed
figure was sitting in a large chair near an oak chest,
on which was a Svres bowl. She looked as if she
had come to stay. There was an irresolute appearance
about the grey-clad figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay in this studio with you here,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the white-robed figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my prerogative to be here,&rdquo; went on the
grey-clad figure. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t belong to age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white-robed figure smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sit there,&rdquo; said the grey-clad figure, &ldquo;as
if the place belonged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; said the one in white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not be able to stay,&rdquo; said the grey-clad
figure warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall stay till I am asked to leave. Then you
can take my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be soon,&rdquo; said the grey-clad figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said the figure in white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come back again,&rdquo; said the grey-clad
figure, but the words lacked confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are asked,&rdquo; said the figure in white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going now,&rdquo; said the grey-clad figure.
&ldquo;If I stay here any longer with you I shall lose
all my personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Doubt flew through the window. She
hated passing through the shaft of sunlight, but
it was the only way out. But Joy remained in the
studio.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck seven. Its
note was like the bell of a miniature cathedral.
There was the sound of wheels in the courtyard.
They stopped.</p>

<p>The door opened and a woman in a black dress
and wide mushroom hat crossed the threshold.
She saw the shaft of sunlight, the oak dresser with
its array of blue plates, and she looked towards the
great chair by the chest. Being a mortal she did
not see the figure seated in it.</p>

<p>But Joy came forward to welcome her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later Miss Mason was eating a supper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>of cold chicken, salad, bread and butter, tinned
peaches and cream. She was being waited on by
a little flower-faced girl in a blue print dress and
a quaint cap and apron. The little girl&rsquo;s name was
Sally.</p>

<p>She had been found through an advertisement,
after Miss Mason had visited registry offices innumerable,
and interviewed cooks fat, cooks
scraggy, cooks superior, cooks untidy, cooks confident,
and cooks deprecating, none of whom had
pleased her. The owners of the registry offices
had considered Miss Mason an impossible person.</p>

<p>Sally&rsquo;s sole references had been that of her
mother, the Sunday-school teacher, and her own
fresh little face. Miss Mason had fallen in love
with her on the spot.</p>

<p>She arrived with a parcel under her arm five
minutes after Miss Mason had entered the studio.
Her box was to come the next morning by the
carrier.</p>

<p>Miss Mason finished her supper and Sally cleared
the table. She then vanished into the minute
kitchen, out of which was an equally minute bedroom.</p>

<p>Miss Mason got up from her chair and went
slowly round the studio. She had spent three
weeks of careful shopping. It was astonishing
how quickly she had found herself going from
place to place, aided by friendly policemen. Her
purchases had been sent to a furniture agent who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>was responsible for their arrangement in the studio.</p>

<p>It was all exactly as she had imagined it would
be. There were the brown walls with the few pictures,
the blue drugget on the floor, and the old
Persian rugs. There was the &ldquo;Winged Victory&rdquo;
on its straight pedestal in one corner. There was
the dresser against one wall, with the blue dinner
service on its shelves. There was the bookcase
filled with books, the only reminder of her old life.
There was the Chesterfield sofa standing at right
angles to the fire-place. There was the corner cupboard,
and a small cupboard with glass doors, in
which were a few bits of rare old china. There
was the easel. There were a few new canvases
against the wall. There was a box full of oil
paints. There were charcoal sticks in another box&mdash;Miss
Mason had found that chalk in bottles was
not the correct thing nowadays. There was a
whole ream of white Michelet paper. There was
a sheaf of brushes in a green earthenware jar.
There was a large mahogany palette hanging on a
nail. It shone smooth and polished like a mirror.</p>

<p>When she had been the round of the studio she
sat down in the big chair and looked at the empty
Svres bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must buy pink roses for that to-morrow,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>She leant back in the chair. The corners of her
mouth were relaxed in a little tender smile. Her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>eyes were shining. She heard the voices of men
crossing the courtyard. They were laughing.
She laughed a little herself. And over and over
again in her heart the words of the lady in the
blue dress were sounding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If happiness comes to you welcome her with
both hands; and with every kiss she gives you
years will roll away from your heart. Happiness
is like the spring, which wakes the world to brightness
after a dreary winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally came back into the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything more I can do for you,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, child. You&rsquo;d better get to bed. Boiled
eggs for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; There was a moment&rsquo;s pause.
Sally had reached the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a young man?&rdquo; Miss Mason&rsquo;s voice was
so gruff that Sally&rsquo;s heart beat uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he live in London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Sally was trembling a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better write to-morrow and ask him to come
to tea on Sunday. Suppose there&rsquo;s room in that
ridiculous kitchen for you both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Sally&rsquo;s voice was joyful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better buy some cake to-morrow. Gingerbread,
plum cake, anything you like. Don&rsquo;t loiter
now. Get to bed like a good girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>And Sally fled, feeling that Miss Mason was a
winged angel in an odd disguise.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Miss Mason herself went to
her bedroom. It was dainty and charming. The
curtains before the window were white muslin,
with outer curtains of white dimity and borders of
tiny pink rosebuds. The quilt covering the bed
was white like the curtains, it also had a border
of pink rosebuds. The carpet was cream-coloured,
the furniture Chippendale.</p>

<p>When Miss Mason was ready for bed she knelt
down, her hands folded on the rosebud-covered
quilt. The old petitions of childhood, still used
by the woman of sixty years, failed her for the
first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; said Miss Mason softly, &ldquo;I am happy,
and I thank You.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>She got into bed. For a long time she lay gazing
into the darkness with open eyes. She was
too happy to sleep. She had become aware of
sounds she had heard at intervals during the evening
almost without realizing them&mdash;singing, the
twanging of banjos, the sound of laughter. Now
in the darkness she heard them clearly. Her old
eyes puckered at the corners into little delighted
wrinkles.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she heard the notes of a violin.
Miss Mason had no knowledge of music, but even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>to her ignorant ears the hand was that of a master.
When it stopped there was silence.</p>

<p>Presently she dozed. Much later she was awakened
from a half-sleep by laughter, footsteps, and
louder singing. The words came to her distinctly.</p>

<p>She lay there smiling, a queer old figure in a
white nightcap, one rather bony hand beating time
softly on the quilt.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fe-el-low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so say all of we.&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p>With a little sigh of supreme content Miss Mason
uttered the one word:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bohemia!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE FAUN IN THE GARDEN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ARNABAS came into his garden in the early
morning sunshine. His hair was still a little
wet, for he had only just had his bath. He was
wearing an old Turkish dressing-gown, purple bedroom
slippers, and was smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>A light wind was blowing through the courtyard.
It scattered the pink petals of a too full-blown la
France rose upon the garden path. They chased
each other round in a little mad dance, first down
the path, then in circles at the foot of the statue of
a little faun playing on a long thin reed. The faun
looked at them with mocking, laughing eyes, while
he piped to their dancing.</p>

<p>A thrush in the laburnum tree looked at Barnabas
for a moment, but as it had already got used to
the fact that he was neither a cat nor a boy with a
stone handy, it began to sing a sweet full-throated
song.</p>

<p>Barnabas fingered a la France rosebud. There
were half a dozen little green blights clinging to
the petals. He blew a cloud of tobacco smoke
round it. The blights smiled at him, so to speak.
It would require something stronger than cigarette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>smoke to remove them from their lodging. Barnabas
let go his hold on the rosebud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I daresay they&rsquo;re enjoying
life and the sunshine as much as I am.
They don&rsquo;t seem to be hurting the roses, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A couple of white butterflies flew into the garden.
One of them settled on the sleeve of his
dressing-gown. Barnabas looked at it. It did not
move, only its wings quivered a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You morsel of life,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
enjoying yourself too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt a sudden odd remorse at the thought of
other butterflies he had long ago enclosed in wide-topped
bottles filled with camphor, and then pinned
down on to pieces of cork. The destructive age
had not lasted long with Barnabas. His love of
Nature was too whole-hearted and genuine.</p>

<p>The door of studio number seven suddenly
opened, and Sally came out in her blue print dress.
She held a duster in her hand which she flapped
two or three times. The butterfly flew away to
perch on the shoulder of the faun.</p>

<p>Sally paused for a moment to sniff the morning
air. She did not see Barnabas. She was feeling
very happy. She was seventeen, it was eight
o&rsquo;clock on a June morning, and last night she had
written to her young man&mdash;a stalwart coal-heaver.
The letter had been written with a stubby end of
pencil on a scrap of paper. The envelope into
which she had put it had not stuck well. It had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>required much pressure from Sally&rsquo;s thumb. The
cleanest thumb will leave a mark on an envelope if
it is much rubbed on it. The envelope had looked
a little dirty, and Sally had sighed. She felt, however,
that the words it contained would more than
make up in Jim&rsquo;s eyes for the smear. Later she
would ask leave to go out and buy a stamp.</p>

<p>Then she saw Barnabas. Her work having lain
hitherto in the kitchen rather than in the upstair
regions, she was not used to the appearance of
young men in Turkish dressing-gowns, and she
blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said Barnabas pleasantly, smiling
at the girl. She made him think of a wild-rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said Sally, and she dropped
a curtsey.</p>

<p>Barnabas looked at her with approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to make curtsies, child?
I thought they&rsquo;d gone out of fashion with Bibles,
brown sugar on bread and butter, and old ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally dropped another curtsey from pure nervousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, mother taught me, sir. She was
still-room maid in a big house before she married
father. She said born ladies curtseyed to the King
and Queen, and we curtseyed to the born ladies&mdash;and
gentlemen,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your mother, child, is not a Socialist,&rdquo;
said Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, mother says,&rdquo; said Sally seriously,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>&ldquo;that Socialism is a lot of silly talk among discontented
people who&rsquo;d be discontented if they had
the moon to play with. She says Christ&rsquo;s socialism
was love and respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas gave a low whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother must be a very remarkable
woman,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, while Sally looked
at him and at the white butterfly which had returned
to perch upon his sleeve. Then a sudden
spirit of mischief, born of the wind of the morning,
took possession of Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we didn&rsquo;t disturb your mistress with our
singing last night,&rdquo; he said. There was a little
glint of gay devilry in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Sally quickly. &ldquo;I asked her
ten minutes ago, sir, and she said, &lsquo;Bless you, no,
child. Enjoyed it. They sounded so delightfully
young and happy. Like to have that kind of
lullaby every night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally was an unconscious mimic. Barnabas got
a sudden and not inaccurate mental image of Miss
Mason as she spoke the words. A little pang of
remorse, not unlike the pang he had experienced at
the thought of the butterflies, smote him as he remembered
his half-joking conversation with Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give your mistress my compliments, and tell
her I am glad we didn&rsquo;t disturb her. Also that I
shall do myself the pleasure of calling upon her at
no very distant date.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Sally, and she turned back towards
the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;what is your
mistress&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason, sir,&rdquo; said Sally. She dropped a
final curtsey and disappeared within the studio.</p>

<p>Barnabas lifted his arm with the butterfly on it,
and brushed its wings lightly against his lips. Apparently
it appreciated the treatment, for it remained
passive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the influence of the morning, the wings
of a white butterfly, or the wild-rose face of that
child?&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy I am going to fall in love with Miss
Mason.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE SIX ARTISTS OF THE COURTYARD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT same afternoon the five other male occupants
of the studios dropped in to tea with
Barnabas. They frequently did. They liked the
cakes he bought at a shop in the Fulham Road,
and, incidentally, they appreciated Barnabas himself.
They had one and all announced their intention
previously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning me to buy cakes,&rdquo; said Barnabas.
And he had sent his man to the Fulham Road to
make the purchases.</p>

<p>Barnabas poured out the tea, which was drunk
out of cream-coloured cups with festoons of flowers
on them. There were not enough chairs, but
a couple of packing-cases had been pressed into
service, and they sat round an oak table&mdash;gate-legged.
Barnabas had picked it up for a mere song
at a filthy little shop in a back street. He was very
proud of the bargain.</p>

<p>The six men were curiously dissimilar in appearance
and in character. One took in the outlines of
that, as one took in their appearance at the first
glance.</p>

<p>Next to Barnabas was Dan Oldfield, huge, red-haired,
and untidy-looking. He was one of a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>family, and had begun his artistic career at a
suburban art school, where he had risen to the post
of pupil teacher, and later to that of assistant master.
At twenty-two he had been left three hundred
a year by an uncle, and had come to London to
study at the Slade Schools. He was now thirty,
and had never lost the idea of minute finish inculcated
in him at the art school. It found expression
in his tiny pictures of almost miniature-like work,
pictures which the palm of one of his huge hands
would have covered.</p>

<p>Beside Dan was Jasper Merton, sallow, clean-shaven,
discontented in expression, his previous
history unknown to the six studios. He painted
altar pieces at low rates for high churches in poor
districts, which paintings were usually the gift of
benevolent and religiously-minded spinster ladies.
He looked&mdash;as Barnabas had once said&mdash;as if he
were wearing a hair shirt for the good of his soul,
and as if the shirt were an extra-prickly one.</p>

<p>Beyond him was Alan Farley, who, like David
of old, was &ldquo;fair and of a ruddy countenance.&rdquo;
Nature had intended him for a cheerful soul, but
art of the ultra-mystic type had taken him prisoner.
He painted shadowy figures with silver stars on
their brows, non-petalled roses, and purple chalices;
he read Swinburne and the poems of Fiona Macleod,
and talked about creative genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Creative genius!&rdquo; Barnabas had said to him
one day. &ldquo;Man, you don&rsquo;t understand the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>principles of it. Your painting is pure slither.
Do you think creation is slither? It&rsquo;s travail, it&rsquo;s
agonizing. What does your work cost you?
Nothing. An airy fancy, half an hour&rsquo;s mental
indigestion, and there&rsquo;s a canvas covered with purples,
greys, and greens. The colour&rsquo;s all right, but
what on earth is the thing worth? I&rsquo;m not talking
monetary jargon. You say that purple mass in
the corner is a veiled woman, and she&rsquo;s talking
through opal mists to a silver star. Who on
earth&rsquo;s going to find that out unless you go round
like a kind of animated catalogue to your own pictures.
Get hold of form, man. Study it. Draw&mdash;draw&mdash;draw&mdash;till
you can express ideas tangibly.
Leave poetry alone for a bit till you&rsquo;re
honoured with the power of understanding it.
You&rsquo;re being mentally sensual and don&rsquo;t know it.
You talk of passion! Great Scot! You don&rsquo;t
understand the meaning of the word, nor the A B C
of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Alan had listened and taken the harangue
meekly, though it had had, apparently, little effect.</p>

<p>Next to Alan was Paul Treherne, seated on a
packing-case. He was a man well above the medium
height, and with a lean-limbed look about
him. He had grey eyes, sad&mdash;like his mouth, which
was partly hidden by a small moustache. Fate had
started him in an office, which he hated. Later she
had taken him abroad, where he had lived in a
tent and under the open sky, where he had experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>hardships few men of his class have known,
and where he had three times been face to face
with death. He had looked at sunsets across open
plains, and seen mountains bathed in gold and purple,
and the crimson fire of tropical evenings. He
had seen the blue shadows of palm trees on yellow
sand; he had seen the scarlet of pomegranate flowers,
the gold of oranges against azure skies, till his
whole being was saturated in colour. And lastly
he had returned to England at the age of twenty-seven
to find in the soft greys and lilacs of smoky
London an even more wonderful charm. He had
then an income of eight hundred a year, four of
which he gave to his widowed mother, who lived
in a little house in Hampshire. He was at last able
to turn to art, which he had always loved passionately,
and from his knowledge of character gained
through much experience of men and women, and
with his wonderful sense of colour, he took to portrait
painting. He now, besides his invested income,
earned, at the age of thirty-seven, about six
hundred a year by his brush. He sang in an untrained
mellow baritone in a way that brought tears
to one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Between Paul and Barnabas was Michael Chester,
a small man, one shoulder higher than the
other, and with one leg shrunken and twisted. He
had had a pencil in his hand since babyhood. In
illustration and line work he excelled, though his
choice of subjects was morbid. His paintings of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>the river and grey London streets were beautiful.
There was something almost Whistler-ish about
them. He had the heart of a true poet, and the
tongue of a cynic, and he played the violin like a
god. An ultra-morbidity regarding his own appearance
had lost him to the world as a public
violinist. Nothing would have induced him to
mount a platform or enter a crowded drawing-room.
The studios alone were given the benefit
of his talent.</p>

<p>And finally, master of the ceremonies, seated on
another packing-case was Barnabas&mdash;tall, brown-haired,
green-eyed, and sunny hearted, outwardly
indolent, and beloved of his fellow-men. He followed
in the footsteps of Paul as a portrait painter,
though he was apt to say it was &ldquo;the devil of a way
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation during tea had somehow
centred round a certain unconscious old lady, who
was at that moment cleaning oil paints from a large
mahogany palette, and looking with humorous disgust
at a canvas on which were large and unsteady
blobs of pink paint above a smear of green and
gold. They were intended to represent pink roses
in a Svres bowl, but had failed horribly in the intention.</p>

<p>The conversation had begun airily enough, five
of the men taking part in it, Barnabas alone being
silent. After about ten minutes it began to be
slightly strained, and three of the men had more or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>less dropped out of it. Dan had, however, continued
to express his views somewhat clearly and
with a certain amount of gruffness. Jasper was
being annoyingly Christian-like in his attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to call on the lady, at all events,&rdquo; he
said at last, with exasperating decision. &ldquo;After
what you two fellows said yesterday I felt that I
at least&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you only, my child,&rdquo; interrupted Barnabas
good-humouredly, speaking for the first time.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going. We begin on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the lady be a trifle overwhelmed?&rdquo;
asked Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean all at the same time, or on the
same day,&rdquo; explained Barnabas. &ldquo;I intended that
we should go in detachments. I thought Dan and
I could begin&mdash;take the initial step, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who next?&rdquo; asked Paul, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jasper and Alan, as Jasper&rsquo;s so keen about it,&rdquo;
said Barnabas. &ldquo;Then you and Michael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael looked at the tip of his cigarette through
half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can leave me out of the little programme,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pay calls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m calling on my great aunt&rsquo;s stepmother
on Sunday,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;Sorry, Barnabas,
but it&rsquo;s a prior engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can send a wire to that purely fictitious
person&mdash;if you know her address&mdash;and put her
off,&rdquo; replied Barnabas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Dan.</p>

<p>Jasper got up from his chair. &ldquo;I will leave you
five to make your own arrangements,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I shall call upon Miss Mason at five o&rsquo;clock on
Monday afternoon. If Alan comes with me I
shall be pleased. I&rsquo;ve got an engagement now.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the studio. There was a very slight and
almost unconscious movement of relief among the
remaining men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your language jarred on his nervous susceptibilities,
Dan,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;And he thinks our
attitude altogether unchristian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish he&rsquo;d get himself fixed up in one of the
panels of his own altarpieces, and carried off to
the highest church in London,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;It
would be much the best place for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not call with him,&rdquo; said Alan firmly. &ldquo;If
I do make a martyr of myself it will be by myself
or with one of you others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then quite suddenly
Barnabas told them of Miss Mason&rsquo;s little speech
to Sally. Somehow he had been unable to mention
it in Jasper&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. Then Dan laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confoundedly sentimental, Barnabas,
my son. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to send that wire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael smiled, a queer twisted smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas has a curious faculty for keeping silence
till the crucial moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>makes some little trivial remark which invariably
manages to upset all our preconceived notions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;as Dan says, a pure sentimentalist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The atmosphere had lightened. Jasper&rsquo;s departure
and Barnabas&rsquo; little speech had had a curious
effect upon it. A mental fog had previously crept
into the studio. It often found its way into the
rooms Jasper entered. Sometimes he seemed to
leave it behind, but it generally came to find him,
creeping thin and ghostlike through the keyhole,
through the cracks in the doors, through the chinks
in the windows, settling thickly round him, and casting
its gloom over the room and the other occupants.</p>

<p>And the gods of Joy and Laughter, who cannot
breathe in such an atmosphere, would silently depart.
Now, however, they had found their way back,
slipping easily and gladly into the place they loved.</p>

<p>When, half an hour later, Michael limped down
the garden path with Paul, he nodded in the direction
of studio number seven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we say Tuesday afternoon for our call?&rdquo;
he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>Paul had a momentary feeling of surprise. He
did not show it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he replied equally carelessly.</p>

<p>And the little faun laughed to hear them, and
piped a madder dance still to the rose-petals which
had whirled below his pedestal at intervals throughout
the day.</p>

<span class="ph3">A MAN&rsquo;S CONSCIENCE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ASPER Merton was a man who had been
born with a curious kind of conscience. He
was perpetually looking at it, dusting it, and seeing
that it kept in what he considered perfect working
order. In reality it only worked spasmodically
and at unexpected intervals. He possessed, also,
an enormous amount of that quality which is generally
termed artistic sensitiveness, but which is
most frequently a polite and pretty name for selfishness.
He see-sawed between conscience and&mdash;it
must be given its right name&mdash;selfishness, in a
manner which made his life not only uncomfortable
to himself, but almost equally uncomfortable
to others.</p>

<p>He had, too, a skeleton which he kept in a cupboard,
in other words, in a small&mdash;a very small&mdash;house
in Chiswick. That skeleton was a woman.
She was his wife, and a secret.</p>

<p>None of his fellow-artists had ever dreamt of
asking him if he were married. It never dawned
on them to ask a man, who was apparently a bachelor
and who obviously disliked the company of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>women, such a question; and he had no near relations
to trouble their heads about him.</p>

<p>He was twenty-three when he married her, and
she was eighteen. She was a slight, fair-haired
girl with blue eyes and a lovable nature. He had
worshipped her to the whole extent of his selfish
disposition. At the end of a year a child had been
born to them. It had lived two years&mdash;a toddling
blue-eyed mite with fair hair like its mother.
It had little caressing ways and soft baby cooings
of laughter.</p>

<p>But one day the laughter had ceased, and from
the nursery had come sounds of a child in anguish.
A basin of boiling water had been left on the table
by a careless nurse, and pulled over by a pair of
small, clutching hands. A week of horror had followed.
The child had lived for four days in agony,
even drugs could not soothe its pain, or quiet the
terrible sobbing voice. Jasper had fled from the
house.</p>

<p>When he had returned his wife had met him
white and tearless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My baby&rsquo;s at peace, thank God,&rdquo; she had said.
And then she had laughed. She had not slept except
from momentary exhaustion for four nights
and days.</p>

<p>Later in the evening he had found her drunk in
the dead child&rsquo;s room. He had carried her from
it and locked the door.</p>

<p>In the morning she had come to him and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>tried to speak. His look of disgust had made
speech impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jasper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she had said brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; he had stammered.
And he had gone from her.</p>

<p>When he had returned in the evening it was to
find her again drunk. This time in the dining-room.</p>

<p>That was the beginning. He had never been
able to hide his disgust, his love had been killed.
Conscience, which held the word Duty before him,
spelling it with a capital, told him to make the best
of things; his sensitiveness shrank from the woman
as from something loathsome.</p>

<p>After the child&rsquo;s funeral she had pulled herself
partially together, and he had never found her
in the same condition again. But she had lost all
her old charm. She grew listless in manner,
slovenly and untidy in dress. Now and then she
would look at him with the eyes of a dumb thing
asking for help. He never saw her eyes. He had
avoided looking at them. The sight of her&mdash;her
untidy hair, her neglected dress&mdash;had offended his
sensitive taste. Little by little they had drifted
mentally further apart. Finally they had separated.
Even the separation had been gradual.
First he had taken his small house in Chiswick
and the studio in Chelsea, living at home, and going
daily to his work. She had known what the
outcome would be, but had said nothing. Later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>he had begun to sleep at the studio, returning only
for the week-end. He had spoken of the distance,
making it an excuse.</p>

<p>And now there was only occasional visits,
prompted entirely by conscience. He had left the
studio to pay one of these visits that afternoon.
An extraordinary priggishness of manner towards
his fellow-men was an invariable preface to them.</p>

<p>As the tram bore him into the suburbs he gave
a little shiver of disgust. The commonplace ugliness
of the houses was an eyesore to him. He
pictured the inhabitants as dull, well-meaning, ultra-respectable&mdash;leading
a carpet-slipper, roast-beef,
little-music-in-the-evenings&mdash;kind of life. He
thought of the men as all old and fat, or young
and conceited; of the women as thin and careworn,
or flashy and bejewelled. His mental pictures
were either extremely commonplace or extremely
tawdry.</p>

<p>Suddenly his conscience began to fidget. It was
becoming uncomfortable. What right had he to
feel like that, it said. They were every bit as good
as he was. Who was he to sit in judgment on his
fellow-men?</p>

<p>He put the mental pictures aside. He said a little
prayer for charity. Then he looked at his conscience
again, and satisfied himself that he had
swept away the dust specks which had caused it a
momentary uneasiness.</p>

<p>But he never thought of the poetry that might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>be hidden away in the lives passed within those ugly
walls, nor listened for the old, old tunes of love
and sorrow, hope and fear, birth and death, that
were played for them as they were played for those
who dwelt in infinitely more picturesque surroundings.
And if he had heard the music he would
probably have said that the metre was out of time,
the notes old and cracked, or thin and tuneless.</p>

<p>At last he left the tram and turned up a side
street. The houses in it were small, red brick, and
each of a pattern exactly like the other. They
stood a little way back from the pavement, separated
from it by a low brick wall on top of which
was an ugly iron railing. Each of the tiny plots
of ground in front of the houses was divided from
the neighbouring plot by more iron railings. Some
of the plots were merely gravel, others grass, while
a few had blossomed out into flower-beds gay with
flowers.</p>

<p>He turned into one of the gravel plots and went
up four steps to the front door. He rang the bell.
His face was perfectly expressionless. It was like
the face of a man who is self-hypnotized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mistress in?&rdquo; he said to the untidy
woman who answered the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Will you come into the sitting-room?
I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper went into the sitting-room. He stood on
the hearthrug in the attitude of a stranger. The
tea-things had not been cleared away, they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>still on the table, which was covered with a white
cloth showing various grease spots. The tea-things
themselves were on a black tin tray with the
enamel scratched off in two or three places. There
was a loaf of bread on the table, a pat of soft-looking
butter on a plate, a pot of strawberry
jam from which the spoon had fallen making
a red smear on the cloth, and a remnant of stale
cake.</p>

<p>The furniture in the room was not ugly, but the
whole place had a desolate look. A French novel
in a yellow paper cover lay open face downwards
on a small table near the hearthrug. Jasper picked
it up, glanced at the title, and put it down again
with a little movement of disgust.</p>

<p>The door opened and a woman came in. She
was wearing a loose and rather shabby brown dress;
her hair, which was really a beautiful pale gold,
looked unbrushed and uncared for. She wore it
parted and in an untidy knot at the nape of her
neck. The only neat thing about her were her
hands, which were small hands, the nails polished
and manicured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Jasper,&rdquo; she said, and she sat
down. She did not even offer to shake hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Bridget,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Is that a gentle reminder to me
of my manners, or a query as to my health? I&rsquo;m
all right, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper stood irresolute. This nonchalant attitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>of his wife pained him. She was usually
more apathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down,&rdquo; she said politely, &ldquo;that
is if you wish to stay for your usual hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper put his hat and stick on the sofa and sat
down on a chair near the table. His eye fell on
the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a new one,&rdquo; he said half
irritably, &ldquo;or at least cover it with a tea-cloth? I
hate these black, scratched things. I don&rsquo;t keep
you short of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced towards the offending article.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often see it, do you?&rdquo; she queried.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it; besides, I haven&rsquo;t an artistic eye.
Emma shall take it away if it displeases you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rang the bell, and the woman who had opened
the front door appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take away the tea-things,&rdquo; said Bridget carelessly.
&ldquo;Mr. Merton doesn&rsquo;t like to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman piled the things on to the tray, and
gathered the cloth in a bundle under one arm. She
left the room with them.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bridget encouragingly, &ldquo;five minutes
of the hour have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper moved impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
is the matter with you this evening, Bridget. I
don&rsquo;t know you in this mood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows with a slightly mocking
expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever notice my moods? That is
news to me. I was waiting for the usual lectures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lecture you.
I don&rsquo;t come here to lecture you. I have only
sometimes asked you to keep your hair tidy and
wear becoming dresses. There&rsquo;s nothing in the
way of a lecture about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly
worth while to trouble, is it? No one sees me
but you, and then only four times a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own self-respect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost that,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is never too late,&rdquo; he said. There was now
a touch of priggishness in his manner. Conscience
had given him a little push.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it is. You
showed me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Jasper was frankly amazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean. I tried
to help you. I&rsquo;ve begged you again and again
to dress decently, to care for your appearance.
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left me.&rdquo; The words were perfectly
quiet. They were the mere statement of a fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Our life together was a misery,&rdquo;
he stammered. &ldquo;I tried for two years to help
you. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you try to help me?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;By talking calm platitudes through a kind of
moral disinfectant sheet&mdash;which you held between
us, unable, for all your high faluting words, to
keep the disgust out of your voice, the loathing
out of your eyes. I had offended your fastidious
taste&mdash;yes, I know I had seemed horrible, that I
was horrible; but how ten thousand times more
horrible do you think I felt to myself? And yet I
knew I had some excuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse,&rdquo; he said sternly, strong in his moral
self-righteousness, &ldquo;excuse for lying drunk in
the room with our dead child.&rdquo; He shuddered.
The memory of the sight filled him with horror.</p>

<p>She put her hand over her eyes. It was shaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you shall have the truth
for once, though I am not speaking it in justification
of myself. Have you ever thought of those
four days and nights of torture, when every cry
of anguish my baby uttered was like a red-hot
needle piercing my heart and brain? Have you
thought that there were moments when I felt in
my wild misery that I must fly from the sound
of them, but that her baby-hands were seeking
mine, her voice calling in vain to me to help
her. You shudder? You shuddered then and
fled. The sensitiveness of your nature could
not stand the sight and sounds of agony. When
at last it ceased, and reason told me my baby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>was at peace, I still heard her voice. The doctor
had sent me to bed. I could not rest. I got up.
I saw you. You went to your own room to weep.
I had gone through the agony alone. I was to
go through the grief alone. I was faint when I
took the brandy. I did not know it would affect
me as it did. I was worn out, and it went to my
head. I heard her voice again. I thought it real
that time. I stumbled upstairs to the room where
you found me. In the morning I remembered
what had happened. I loathed myself. I came to
you and saw the same loathing in your eyes. The
next few days I drank purposely to gain oblivion,
and I hated myself for doing it more than you can
ever have hated me. But one night I thought I
saw my baby&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she paused. &ldquo;I never took the
stuff again, though there were moments when I
longed for it. I wanted to ask your help, to tell
you what I had suffered. I could not. I saw the
look in your eyes. It kept awake in me the memory
of that&mdash;that day. Only at night, in the darkness,
I forgot it. I could feel my baby in my arms, her
hair against my lips&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a dead silence: Jasper
broke it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not understand,&rdquo; he said. It was an
admission on his part. At the time she did not
realize it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did not,&rdquo; she said, and a trace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>of weariness had found its way into her voice.
&ldquo;You would never understand what offended your
taste. For a crime alone you might find excuse,
provided it was sufficiently picturesque. For mere
sordidness there is none in your eyes. You said
it was not too late. I say it is. For years your
refinement and your conscience have been at war.
You have not had the moral courage to leave me,
nor the manhood to help me&mdash;to help me to regain
the self-respect I lost seven years ago. I am tired
at last of you, tired of these perfunctory visits.
They can end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jasper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply that I don&rsquo;t want to see you again.
You can&rsquo;t get a divorce&mdash;I have at least been faithful
to you; there is not even cause for a legal separation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bridget!&rdquo; he cried, shocked. &ldquo;I have never
wanted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held up her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t protest, Jasper. Actions speak a
good deal louder than words. You have hated
these four yearly visits quite as much as I have.
Your conscience has ordered you to make them.
You have kept it quiet by a quarterly journey to
Chiswick. Your refinement has shrunk more each
time from the sight of me. The fact that Duty
alone was urging you to it has made it more difficult
for you. Now it is I who say they must
cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my wife,&rdquo; he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;You always had little sense of
humour, Jasper, and now I think that little must
have died. You don&rsquo;t understand what I mean?
That shows it is quite&mdash;quite dead. I am now
going to take all responsibility off your shoulders
by refusing to see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall go away where you cannot find
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you live if I don&rsquo;t know where you
are?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You have no money of your
own. I must send you some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you have considered it your duty to
make me an allowance,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and in my
candid opinion that is still your duty. If, however,
you persist in coming to see me I shall make
it impossible for you to send me money by going
away where you will be unable to find me. I can
work. It might be better for me to do so. You
can decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall send you the money,&rdquo; he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not attempt to see me&mdash;you promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You force me into giving the promise. I can&rsquo;t
let my wife work for her living, or starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up from her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, that is understood. I&rsquo;ve taken
you by surprise this afternoon. I think I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>surprised myself. At present you resent my interference
with your conscience. Later you will
feel the relief. Now, though your hour is not yet
up, it would be wiser if we said good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got to his feet. The whole interview had
been so unexpected he was feeling a little dazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jasper.&rdquo; She held out her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bridget.&rdquo; Then Conscience&mdash;the
officious&mdash;spoke. Jasper bent forward to kiss his
wife.</p>

<p>She drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather ridiculous?&rdquo; she asked, with a
hint of sarcasm in her voice.</p>

<p>Jasper flushed. He hated anything approaching
ridicule. He had taken her word-slashings quietly.
They had not yet even fully penetrated his plate-armour
of self-righteousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only thought
that as I was not seeing you again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three months or a lifetime! It doesn&rsquo;t make
much difference to us, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He met her eyes. Beneath the look in them his
own fell. For the first time in his life he experienced
something like genuine shame, not the little
meretricious prickings of conscience with which he
was wont to bewail his small or imaginary sins.
To his great short-comings he was blind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hate me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said shortly, &ldquo;for a wonder, I don&rsquo;t.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>He went to the door, opened it, and passed out.
A second later she heard the iron gate clang to,
and his receding steps on the pavement.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment listening, then turned
towards the hearth. She put her hand up to the
mantelpiece and gripped it hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only he had helped me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;God,
why didn&rsquo;t you let me die with my baby?&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">VISITORS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ISS Mason was sitting in her studio at
four o&rsquo;clock on Sunday afternoon. She
was reading a small, red-covered book, within
whose pages was enshrined a brief account of the
life and work of Whistler.</p>

<p>At intervals she looked up from her reading to
glance round the studio and smile. It was her
dream incarnate. She had waited forty-three
years for its birth. She realized now that she had
always wanted it, had always believed in it.
All through the old days in the rose-beds, when
she had pruned the trees, when she had grafted
new buds, when she had watched the flowers
expanding, she had dreamt of this studio. Only
at moments it had looked real; generally it was
far off and shadowy, but always it had been
before her, and something had whispered to her
heart, &ldquo;Wait; one day it will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now it was no faint shadowy dream, but
a living reality, and it would bring more glorious
realities in its train. Nothing could be too
wonderful to happen in the castle of her dreams.</p>

<p>Again she looked round the studio, and again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>she smiled. She would have liked to sing for
happiness, only her voice was too gruff and
cracked. She would have liked to dance for joy,
only her old legs were too stiff. But she minded
neither of these things, for her heart was beating
to a little gay secret tune in which joy and thankfulness
were woven in delicious harmony.</p>

<p>From behind the door that led to the tiny
kitchen she heard murmured sounds and an occasional
deep laugh. Sally&rsquo;s scrappy little note
had been answered by the appearance of Jim
in his Sunday-best, shining from the washtub,
redolent of yellow soap, every trace of his black
weekday occupation removed. They were now
cooing like a pair of young turtle-doves in a
cage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Mason was startled by a knock.</p>

<p>A moment later the door which led from the
studio to the little vestibule opened, and Sally
announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kirby and Mr. Oldfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason&rsquo;s heart fluttered. It is an odd
emotion, and now nearly out of fashion. It
belonged to the days of &ldquo;Cranford,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility.&rdquo; Now all emotions are
big and passionate, or calm and well-controlled.
There are few gentle excitements left.</p>

<p>In spite of the fluttering, Miss Mason rose to her
feet, a quiet dignified old figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to see you,&rdquo; she said, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>she gave them each her hand with the air of a
queen. &ldquo;Sally,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;bring tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down again. There was a little pink
flush in her cheeks. For forty-three years she
had spoken to no man of her own class except
the vicar and doctor. The interview with Mr.
Davis being purely on business did not count.</p>

<p>Barnabas and Dan put their caps on the oak
chest beside the Svres bowl which was filled with
the pink roses with whose portraiture Miss Mason
had so sadly failed. Then they sat down.</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Even Barnabas&rsquo;
mental picture of Miss Mason&mdash;a picture supplied
by Sally&rsquo;s unconscious imitation of her&mdash;had
not quite come up to the quaintness of the reality.
He felt that he had suddenly stepped back at
least a century. There was about the atmosphere
a hint of potpourri and long ago half-forgotten
days that are laid up in lavender. There was a
completeness about the whole thing&mdash;from the oak
dresser with its blue plates, the Svres bowl and
the pink roses, to the woman in her voluminous
black dress, wide white collar, and abundant
grey hair covered with the finest of old lace caps&mdash;a
completeness that only an artist could fully
realize, though most people would have felt.</p>

<p>She was so extraordinarily ugly too. No
ordinary commonplace plainness of feature, but
downright ugliness, yet without the smallest
trace of repulsiveness in it. It was a fascinating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>kind of ugliness, and the eyes in the ugly face&mdash;they
alone were really beautiful&mdash;shone like bits
of red-brown amber. It is a colour rarely seen.</p>

<p>Barnabas broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your studio,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is charming. Dan
and I watched the furniture coming in on Thursday
morning. If it is not impertinent of me, may
I congratulate you on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the first studio I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but it&rsquo;s the kind
I always wanted. Have always pictured studios
in my mind like this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky in your mental images,&rdquo; said
Dan. &ldquo;If you saw ours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; said Miss Mason anxiously,
&ldquo;yours is the real thing, and mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;is the dream to
which we aspire, and to which we cannot achieve.
When you see ours&mdash;and we hope you will honour
us with your presence&mdash;you will realize how very
far short of our aspirations they must fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Miss Mason almost wistfully,
&ldquo;you paint real pictures in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to do so,&rdquo; said Dan gruffly, &ldquo;and a few
of us succeed. Even in that most of us fail as we
fail in our furniture. Paul and Michael are our
geniuses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul and Michael?&rdquo; queried Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Treherne and Mr. Chester,&rdquo; explained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>Barnabas. &ldquo;They live in studios numbers one
and three respectively. Jasper Merton has number
five, Alan Farley number four, Dan number two,
and mine is number six, next door to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The garden with the faun,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The garden with the faun,&rdquo; replied Barnabas.
And then he got up to move a table for Sally,
who had come in with the tea-things, blue willow
china on a tray covered with the daintiest of
damask cloths. She brought in more dishes with
cakes and bread and butter, and a copper kettle
which was singing its heart out on a little spirit
lamp. Then she left the room.</p>

<p>Miss Mason warmed the teapot and the tea-cups,
measured the tea, and filled the teapot with
boiling water. Then she took up the sugar-tongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One lump each,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>She put the little cubes into the cups, poured
in milk and tea, and handed the cups to the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help yourselves,&rdquo; she said. Then she looked
up and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am quite delighted to see you,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to do the talking. Don&rsquo;t
suppose I&rsquo;ve spoken more than six words a day
for the last twenty years, till the last three
weeks. Then it has been entirely about furniture.
I&rsquo;ve got out of the way of conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas will supply the need,&rdquo; said Dan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>&ldquo;He has the biggest flow of conversation I&rsquo;ve
ever met. Only it&rsquo;s largely nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should like nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Never talked nonsense in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; queried Barnabas politely, his eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>Then they all three laughed. And in the laugh
Miss Mason forgot that she was trying to hide
her shyness, for it suddenly disappeared, and there
was nothing left to hide. She forgot that she
had never set eyes on the men till ten minutes
ago. She was no longer a hostess trying to feel
at ease with strangers. She was just a happy
woman talking to two happy men, the difference
in age forgotten. Such a magic god is laughter.</p>

<p>And before an hour was over Miss Mason felt
that she knew all about them. Not the things
in which some people consider the knowledge of
their fellow-men to consist&mdash;their father&rsquo;s profession,
their mother&rsquo;s family, their relationship
to various grandees, the towns in which they have
lived, the schools at which they have been
educated, the number of their brothers and their
sisters, all of which, if you come to think of it,
are pure accidents, and have nothing to do with
the man himself.</p>

<p>It was none of these things Miss Mason learnt.
She found out that Barnabas had a universal
love for nature and his fellow-men, in fact, for
everything alive; and that his heart was as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>sunny as his laugh. And that Dan&rsquo;s rather gruff
manner hid a heart as tender as a woman&rsquo;s.
There were a thousand minor characteristics she
would discover by and by, but these were the
salient facts, and showed the true man.</p>

<p>When they said good-bye it was with a promise
from her to visit their studios, and with an
assurance from them that the other four men
were going to call on her.</p>

<p>They did&mdash;Jasper Merton the next day alone;
Paul, Alan, and Michael on the Tuesday. Barnabas
and Dan had broken the ice for her, and Miss
Mason received them with little trepidation.
Having come once they came again.</p>

<p>And not one of them guessed in what a curious
way the influence of the quaint old lady was to
be woven into the lives of at least three of them.
For the Three Fates, who sit all day long spinning
in three great black chairs, are strange and
ancient dames, and they saw in Miss Mason a
kindred spirit. In fact, they laughed to think
of her likeness to them as she sat in the carved
oak chair in her studio with her knitting in her
hands.</p>

<p>And Miss Mason took one and all of the six
artists of the courtyard to her heart and loved
them spontaneously as a mother loves her sons.
But Jasper she guessed was unhappy, and she
was sorry for him, and she was a tiny bit afraid
of Michael&rsquo;s tongue and Alan she did not quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>understand, and Paul she was as proud of as if he
were truly her son, and Dan gave her a delightful
feeling of being protected, he was so big, but
Barnabas&mdash;though she loved them all&mdash;took the
first place in her heart.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="ph3">THE CASA DI CORLEONE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;C</span>HRISTOPHER, darling,&rdquo; said the
Duchessa di Corleone in honeyed accents,
&ldquo;I want you to find an artist for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; replied Christopher. &ldquo;Where
did you lose him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Christopher,&rdquo; said the Duchessa,
&ldquo;he is not lost, because he has never been found.
You are to find him&mdash;a pleasant, clever, interesting
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was sitting in the drawing-room of her
house on the Embankment. The windows looked
on to the river which she loved. The room was
full of flowers which she also loved. She arranged
them herself in a room off the dining-room,
and carried them upstairs in her arms
like children. Every one who loves and arranges
flowers knows that in their transit from one
place to another the whole carefully-careless
effect of their arrangement may be spoiled.
Therefore from the moment of entering the
strings that tied the great bundles fresh from
Covent Garden, to the moment of placing the
vases in the drawing-room, no hand but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>Duchessa&rsquo;s touched the flowers. And there was
no flower in existence whose colour could jar in
the room which was a harmony in pale lavender.
To have to exclude a flower on account of its
colour would have been to Sara di Corleone like
shutting the door on a child because its face
was ugly. And being the very essence of womanhood
she could have done neither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the artist is found,&rdquo; queried
Christopher, &ldquo;may I ask what are your intentions
towards him? I have a conscience, Sara, though
you may not realize the fact, and if you wish to
inmesh the young man in your silken toils
merely for the pleasure of seeing him wriggle,
then I fear duty will oblige me to refrain from
helping you in your search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara smiled. &ldquo;I want him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
paint my portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds dangerous&mdash;for the artist,&rdquo; said
Christopher. &ldquo;May I further ask to whom the
portrait is to be presented?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Casa di Corleone on the banks of
Lake Como,&rdquo; said Sara quietly.</p>

<p>Christopher looked enquiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never seen the place,&rdquo; said Sara,
&ldquo;but I have told you about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; said Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; pursued Sara, &ldquo;you must come
with me to see it. Then I think you will understand.
I want you to see the courtyard with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>orange trees and fountains, the little naked
marble fauns and the nymphs who stand among
them glistening in the sunlight. I want you to
see the rooms full of shadows and great patches
of sunshine; and the gallery with its pictured
men and women of the house of Corleone, the
dark-eyed haughty women&mdash;beauties every one
of them&mdash;the gay young men and the courtly
old ones. I want my portrait to be among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t conceit,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;At least I don&rsquo;t
think it is. I love that place, Christopher. It
seems as if it belongs to me&mdash;had always belonged
to me; I mean, long before I knew Giuseppe. I
want to think that in the years to come my
picture will be hanging there, looking down into
the old hall, and that when the door is open I
shall catch a glimpse of the courtyard bathed in
sunlight, see the gleam of golden oranges and
white marble figures, and hear the plashing of
the fountain. It&rsquo;s just a fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fancy,&rdquo; said Christopher, with a little
gesture, &ldquo;as charming as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara laughed. &ldquo;Christopher, I love you. And
you ought to have lived in the days of Queen
Elizabeth, or, better still, at the Court of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your affection,&rdquo; said Christopher.
&ldquo;One day when we are both in a mad mood we
will run away together, and pick oranges from
the trees in the courtyard of Casa di Corleone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>And we will play at ball with them across the
fountain&mdash;golden balls tossed through a shower
of silver. The idea appeals to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad Casa di Corleone is mine,&rdquo; said
Sara, &ldquo;though mine with reservations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no entail on the estate?&rdquo; asked
Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t understand the ins and outs of
the matter, but it was my husband&rsquo;s to do with
as he pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was thoughtful of the Duca to leave it to
you,&rdquo; said Christopher. &ldquo;He might have turned
it into a home for stray dogs. There are a good
many in Italy, aren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara had scarcely heard him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked Giuseppe,&rdquo; she said pensively. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;better when he was alive. I feel
slightly irritable now when I think of him. I
dislike feeling irritable. It is a prickly sensation
and doesn&rsquo;t suit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The will?&rdquo; asked Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. The will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Christopher, &ldquo;you are not
thinking of again entering the holy bonds of
matrimony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Sara assured him, &ldquo;is further
from my thoughts. But&mdash;if I wanted to!&mdash;Think
of it, Christopher! I lose every centesimo&mdash;every
single centesimo <i>and</i> Casa di Corleone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>Fancy parting with it! Besides, there is that
ridiculous letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, mock-tragedy in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of any letter,&rdquo; said Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It was almost
the most provoking thing Giuseppe did. It
roused my curiosity&mdash;I am curious. Christopher&mdash;with
one hand, and took away every possibility
of my satisfying it with the other. I can quote
the last phrases of the will verbatim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leant back in her chair, her eyes half-closed, and spoke slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I further decree that if my wife Sara
Mary di Corleone, <i>ne</i> de Courcy, shall again enter
the married state, that she shall immediately
forfeit all the money and estates herein willed
to her, and shall have no further claim upon them
whatsoever. And that they shall, in the case of
her marriage, pass into the possession of my
nephew, Antonio di Corleone. And I leave in
the hands of my executors&mdash;before herein named&mdash;a
letter, sealed and addressed to my wife the
above Sara Mary di Corleone, <i>ne</i> de Courcy,
which letter, in the event of her marriage, shall
be given into her hands one hour precisely after
the ceremony has taken place. In the event of
her demise without re-marriage, the said letter
shall be destroyed unopened by and in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>presence of the executors above-named. Written
by me this fourteenth day of January,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Sara opened her eyes and sat up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all signed and witnessed just a year
before he died. It&rsquo;s all horribly correct. Fixed
up as firmly as yards of red tape can tie it. And
if I marry I lose every centesimo and my beloved
Casa di Corleone, and if I don&rsquo;t marry I shall
never see the inside of that letter. Did you ever
know such a trying situation for a luxury-loving
and curious woman in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; said Christopher, &ldquo;that the
curiosity does not trouble you greatly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;But the
will! You must allow that is annoying. It puts
my mind and my affections in a kind of mental
strait-jacket. Every time I see a charming
man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, for instance,&rdquo; said Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mercifully not you,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;We
are one of the few exceptions that prove the
generally accepted rule of the non-existence of
platonic friendship between men and women.
You are the most delightful combination of
friend and father-confessor that ever existed,
without&mdash;Heaven be praised&mdash;a trace of the
lover. Where was I before you interrupted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking at a charming man,&rdquo; said Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Whenever I see a charming man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>I have to tell myself to be careful, to run no risk
of my heart getting in the smallest degree
involved. I call up mental pictures of coffers
upon coffers&mdash;thousands of them&mdash;crammed with
centesimi. I shut my eyes and see the courtyard,
the oranges, and the marble fauns, then I open
them and look at the charming man and feel
more secure. But I daren&rsquo;t run the tiniest risk
for fear of the consequences. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; she
almost wailed the words, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even flirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As your father-confessor,&rdquo; said Christopher,
&ldquo;I am glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But think,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;what I lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Christopher, &ldquo;what the man
would lose, and have a fellow-feeling for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very unsympathetic,&rdquo; said Sara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I am very sympathetic&mdash;towards
the man, who, but for the late Duca&rsquo;s
will, might be wriggling, as I said before, in your
silken toils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; said Sara, suddenly and quite
seriously, &ldquo;do you think I shall ever marry
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly hope you will,&rdquo; replied
Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lose Casa di Corleone and the coffers of
centesimi!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then again she was
back to the serious mood. &ldquo;Why do you hope
so, Christopher?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>For a moment Christopher was silent. Then
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear, I know you and your
capabilities. One day you will realize the gift
you have in your possession, and in giving it away
you will be one of the happiest women on God&rsquo;s
earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give very
much to Giuseppe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You liked him,&rdquo; smiled Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a dear,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;He was extraordinarily
considerate, and we were always beautifully
polite to each other. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Christopher. &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash; One
day a force will take you prisoner. Gifts will be
showered on you, and you will shower gifts, and
that little word of three letters, which stands for
so much, will have no place in your vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall give up everything?&rdquo; she queried
below her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will give up everything, because you
will have gained everything,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Christopher lifted his shoulders the tiniest
fraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is some knowledge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which
is born in one, and of which one need no experience
in this incarnation. Probably I brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>mine with me from the experience of ages long
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence.</p>

<p>Outside there was a clack of horses&rsquo; hoofs, the
roll of carriages, the hoot of taxis, all the sounds
of London to which one grows so accustomed
that one hears them even less than one hears the
humming of insects in a sunny garden. And
away below the window was the river, gliding
grey and noiseless to the sea.</p>

<p>It was a November day with a hint of fog in
the atmosphere. A fire was burning in the room
in which the two were sitting, and great yellow
chrysanthemums like patches of sunlight were in
bowls set on the tables.</p>

<p>And in the silence the woman was looking
almost for the first time into her heart with a
kind of wonder for what she might find hidden
there. And the man, whose nature was one of
queer self-analysis, was marvelling that his feeling
towards the woman near him held nothing but
strong affection and a curious interest in her
vivid and unusual personality. Perhaps the cause
lay in the fact that he had known her from childhood,
and seen her gradual development. She
had never flashed unexpected and meteor-like
across his path.</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked up at him with one of her
individual smiles&mdash;a smile that lit up her eyes
before it found its way to her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have wandered a long way from my
request,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To find an artist for you?&rdquo; said Christopher.
&ldquo;Oh, I know a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she asked, all interest. &ldquo;What is
he like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever,&rdquo; said Christopher, &ldquo;pleasant, and&mdash;yes,
I think you&rsquo;ll find him interesting. I think
those were your three requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said Christopher, &ldquo;is Paul
Treherne, and he lives at a studio about ten
minutes&rsquo; walk from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul Treherne,&rdquo; she said slowly, dwelling on
the words. &ldquo;I like that name. Is he as nice as
his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall leave you to judge,&rdquo; replied Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better bring him to see me,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;To-morrow at tea-time will do. You
can ring me up in the morning and tell me if he
is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; He glanced towards the clock
on the mantelpiece, a beautiful little French clock.
The hands pointed to half-past three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an appointment
at my club. I&rsquo;ll go round to the studio first.&rdquo; He
got up from his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can telephone from the club,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>said Sara. &ldquo;I am not going out again till this
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; He held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he will be able to come,&rdquo; said Sara.
&ldquo;I like his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not to fall in love with him,&rdquo; said
Christopher warningly, &ldquo;or let him fall in love
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember Casa di Corleone and the golden
oranges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that one day I was to
forget them.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">A MEETING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE comes a day in the lives of some of
us when everything appears as if it were
pursuing its ordinary and normal course. We get
up in the morning and go through the usual
routine&mdash;bath, dressing, breakfast, all the little
accustomed trivialities which have happened thousands
of times in our lives already, and which will
doubtless happen thousands of times again. We
feel gay or dull as we have felt thousands of times
before, and we think, or we don&rsquo;t think, of the
various occupations that will go to make up our
day, and we never guess that before sunset we
shall have our hand on a door&mdash;a door that when
opened is to lead the way into clouds of sorrow,
or gild our life suddenly with the radiant light of
joy. So silently do the fates work, so secret do
they keep their intentions from us.</p>

<p>Paul got up that morning as usual at seven
o&rsquo;clock. He had his usual cold bath, which most
people would have found uncomfortably chilly on
a November morning, but in which Paul found
merely a refreshing sting. He rubbed himself dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>while humming an air from &ldquo;The Arcadians,&rdquo; and
then put on his clothes. He went into his studio
and found his usual breakfast of coffee and rolls
ready for him. While he ate it he looked into a
neat brown pocket-book to refresh his memory as
to his engagements for the day.</p>

<p>A small girl was coming to sit for him at ten
o&rsquo;clock. Her name was Marjorie Arnold. She
was possessed of personality and a fascinating dimple.
He had caught the personality, but the dimple
had hitherto eluded him. It was extremely
fleeting in its appearance. He hoped to catch it
and place it on canvas that morning.</p>

<p>There was only one other entry for the day&mdash;&ldquo;4.15.
C.C.&rdquo; It meant that Christopher Charlton
was coming for him that afternoon, and would
take him to call on the Duchessa di Corleone, who
desired to have her portrait painted.</p>

<p>He felt a certain amount of interest as to the
Duchessa&rsquo;s appearance, but it was only an interest
he had felt dozens of times before concerning possible
commissions. Christopher had said she was
good-looking. So were a good many people who
were no use to Paul as subjects. He painted only
those who interested him. From the others&mdash;and
there were many&mdash;he politely evaded accepting
commissions. He was very much an artist, was
Paul. And for this reason partly his income was
considerably below the amount his genius warranted.
The other reason was that there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>many people who did not consider his portraits to
be likenesses.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the child appeared with the nurse,
who was dismissed for a couple of hours, and
armed with brushes and palette Paul set to work
to catch the fleeting dimple.</p>

<p>The child&mdash;she was five years old&mdash;was in a
solemn mood. Smiles, and with them the dimple,
had temporarily vanished. She was a quaint little
thing with red hair and freckles, and a fascinating
ugliness generally termed the <i>beaut de diable</i>.</p>

<p>Paul told her half a dozen stories, including &ldquo;The
Three Bears&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Frog Prince&rdquo;, and Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Stute Little Fish.&rdquo; But neither the squeakiness
of the little bear, the faithlessness of the
princess, nor the sufferings of the whale when the
shipwrecked mariner danced hornpipes in his inside
had any effect on the dimple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Paul at last, &ldquo;that you tell me
a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face was even more solemn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make up one,&rdquo; suggested Paul.</p>

<p>There was the ghost of a smile, then solemnity.
The flash of hope Paul had experienced died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Onst upon a time,&rdquo; she began gravely, &ldquo;vere
was a little dog <i>an&rsquo;</i> a little duck. An&rsquo; vey grewed
wings, an&rsquo; vey flewed up an&rsquo; up an&rsquo; up to heaven
to God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause for effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a height,&rdquo; said Paul admiringly, watching
her face. &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When vey got vere,&rdquo; went on the voice solemnly,
&ldquo;you bet vey wanted to see round. But
God said, &lsquo;Not to-day, I guess I&rsquo;m busy. It&rsquo;s my
last day up here.&rsquo; It was. &rsquo;Cos ve next day&mdash;God
died. Isn&rsquo;t vat a nice story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No trace of a dimple. Paul was exasperated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit a nice story,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;And
God couldn&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her head on one side and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not weally, of course. But ve little dog
an&rsquo; ve little duck had never <i>seen</i> anybody die, an&rsquo;
vey wanted to. So God showed them.&rdquo; She was
laughing at him now in childish triumph, a very imp
of mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; cried Paul. And his brush flew to
the canvas. Such are the trials and triumphs of
portrait painters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and look at it,&rdquo; said Paul after ten minutes.</p>

<p>She scrambled down from the chair and platform
and came round. A small mocking face of
pure wickedness looked at her from the canvas.
Her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see it?&rdquo; said Paul, pointing at it with
his brush. &ldquo;And but for your profane little story
there would never have been exactly that expression
on your face. We wait for our moments, we
artists, and we catch them&mdash;sometimes. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you can have a stick of chocolate
and brown your face up to the eyebrows with
it. I have finished your portrait, and therefore
done with you. I don&rsquo;t care what happens to you
now."</p>

<p>That was Paul. During the time of painting he
sought for intimate knowledge of his subjects.
Every tiniest characteristic, every fleeting expression,
were noted and stored up in his memory. He
could almost have told you their life history from
his minute observation of faces. He knew his subjects
as few of their intimate friends knew them.
He guessed their hidden secrets with a power that
was almost uncanny&mdash;secrets known only to their
own souls&mdash;and put the secrets on his canvas.
And it was for this reason that many people did
not consider the portraits to be likenesses. He
painted the real person, not merely the mask they
wore to the world at large.</p>

<p>This fact had been particularly emphasized in
his portrait of a certain statesman&mdash;one Lord St.
Aubyn. The statesman has nothing to do with the
rest of this story, but the incident as far as Paul is
concerned is interesting.</p>

<p>St. Aubyn was a man who was much before the
public, and no less than five portraits of him had
been commissioned by different societies as a token
of their personal gratitude. Four of these, but for
the individuality of technique, might have been replicas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>one of the other, and gave instant satisfaction
alike to donors and public.</p>

<p>They showed a man with regular features and
deep-set eyes, leaning to the accepted military type,
a resolute mouth, and a certain air of distinction
and command. One felt that a sculptor of the
&ldquo;classic convention&rdquo; would have expressed the
type even more admirably. Reserve was there, but
with no hint of mystery or evasion; intellectuality,
but little imagination.</p>

<p>The fifth portrait by Paul was, one would have
said, of another man. It was a picture that seemed
alive with a strange and slightly repellent magnetism,
for the eyes smiled at a stranger with a
baffling mockery; they seemed to invite and yet defy
his judgment&mdash;to taunt him with his impotence
and read the soul behind them.</p>

<p>It had been received on exhibition with a storm
of outspoken criticism; while the Benevolent
Trustees who had commissioned it, though refraining
from audible dissatisfaction, had maintained so
eloquent a silence at their private view, glancing at
each other with liftings of eyebrows and pursing of
lips, that Paul had flung round upon them and relieved
their embarrassment by declaring the contract
to be null and void. No reasons were asked
for or given; the action was taken as a tacit admission
of failure. Yet Paul himself had seemed not
ill-satisfied, and had met the chaff which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>greeted him from many of his circle with equanimity.</p>

<p>Landor, one of the circle, whose portrait of St.
Aubyn in the previous Academy had been hailed
as a most masterly piece of work, had ventured a
serious protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he had said one evening,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re letting your imagination play tricks with
you. It&rsquo;s becoming an absolute disease. I made
a most careful study of the man&mdash;made him give
me innumerable sittings, and I pledge you my word
that I put everything into the face that I could find.
You had three sittings, and God only knows what
you&rsquo;ve put there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul had smoked for a few moments in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve hit it,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
nothing to say against your &lsquo;Portrait of a rising
Statesman.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a fine piece of work. But you
know all about the Factories Sanitation Amendment
Act, and I can read Sub-section Ten in your
handling of the chin. Now I don&rsquo;t read the papers,
and I know nothing of the man. I tried to get at
him and he shut the door in my face. Yet something
came through the keyhole and the cracks by
the hinges, and I have painted that. And, as you
say, God only knows what I&rsquo;ve put in his face; I
don&rsquo;t. And in spite of that&mdash;or perhaps because
of it&mdash;what I&rsquo;ve put there happens to be the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have you done with the picture?&rdquo;
Landor had asked. &ldquo;The Benevolent refused it,
didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re getting coarse,&rdquo; had been Paul&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;We agreed to differ as to its suitability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In St. Aubyn&rsquo;s study, I believe,&rdquo; had been the
careless reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He bought it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Landor had looked at Paul, and had refrained
from putting further questions. There had been
an expression in Paul&rsquo;s face which might have made
them appear an impertinence.</p>

<p>The gift of the picture had come about in rather
a curious way.</p>

<p>Paul never let his sitters see unfinished work,
and St. Aubyn had left town immediately after the
third sitting, and had not returned till the exhibition
was over. Then he had gone to Paul&rsquo;s studio
and had seen the picture. He had made one remark,
but that was eloquent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo; he had said.</p>

<p>Paul had looked at him, and the next moment
the mask had been on again, and he had been talking
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sold this portrait, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
had asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately not,&rdquo; Paul had replied. &ldquo;It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>seems to give offence to your numerous admirers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if you will allow me, I should like to
become the purchaser,&rdquo; had been the reply.</p>

<p>Paul had looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for sale,&rdquo; he had said.</p>

<p>St. Aubyn had bowed and taken up his hat without
so much as looking disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll send it round to your house to-morrow,&rdquo;
Paul had said.</p>

<p>St. Aubyn had refused. He had talked polite
platitudes regarding the value of the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking Stock Exchange,&rdquo; Paul had
told him. &ldquo;The latest marked quotation is absolutely
nil. No one will look at it. As a piece of
property it is worthless. As a revelation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
had stopped.</p>

<p>St. Aubyn had smiled. &ldquo;I deal in revelations&mdash;professionally,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>That had told Paul the secret he had already
guessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a head-line for the evening papers,&rdquo;
he had said whimsically. &ldquo;&lsquo;A Peer&rsquo;s Secret!
Threatened Exposure by Eminent Artist!&rsquo; But
I&rsquo;m not a blackmailer, and I don&rsquo;t take hush-money.
The picture is yours or no one&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had argued a little more. At last St.
Aubyn had taken it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And about the inscription?&rdquo; It had been
Paul&rsquo;s parting shot. &ldquo;From a painter to
a&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>St. Aubyn had shaken his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Experience is against endorsements, however
cryptic, on secret documents,&rdquo; he had said.
&ldquo;Sooner or later the cipher is sure to be read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he had gone away, leaving Paul the sole
possessor of his secret, a secret which Paul had
summed up in one brief sentence addressed to a
Chinese idol on his mantelpiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man, God help him, is a poet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A month later he had received a small volume of
poems addressed in a hand in which he had already
received three short notes agreeing to sittings.
The verses&mdash;true poetry&mdash;were written under a
<i>nom de plume</i>. What St. Aubyn&rsquo;s reason was for
keeping his poetical talent a secret from the world
Paul never knew. The volume came to him in silence
from the author; he respected the silence,
attempting no word of thanks. And the secret his
insight had wrested from the man went with other
secrets somewhere away in the hidden recesses of
his mind, while his work alone absorbed him.</p>

<p>He never pursued his knowledge of men and
women further. It sufficed&mdash;or seemed to suffice
him&mdash;to portray that knowledge on canvas, and
leave it for those to read who had the heart to do
so. As he had passed before among men and
women of varied nationalities, making no real
friends, so he passed now among varied types,
noting them, painting them, and dismissing them,
still making no friend. The lonely reserve he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>gained in his wanderings pursued him now. He
could not throw it off. Barnabas and Dan were
nearer true friendship with him than any, and more
because they had silently accepted him for their
friend than from any advance on his part. It
seemed that he could make none. The solitude of
the plains, the loneliness of big spaces, seemed to
have claimed his spirit.</p>

<p>And so he painted portraits, from statesmen to
small girls, gaining intimate knowledge of them,
while no one yet had learnt to know the real Paul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was very much later in the day, long after
Marjorie had departed led by an indignant nurse
muttering to herself regarding the carelessness of
&ldquo;them artists,&rdquo; for not only Marjorie&rsquo;s face, but
her best white dress was covered with various
smears of brown chocolate&mdash;it was long after this
that Paul looked once more at his pocket-book. He
looked at it to make sure that the hour Christopher
would arrive for him was four-fifteen, and not
four o&rsquo;clock. The former was there plainly inscribed,
written by Paul with a small gold pencil.</p>

<p>There were just two entries for that day&mdash;Friday,
November 27th, &ldquo;M.A. 10 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; and
&ldquo;4.15 o&rsquo;clock. C.C.&rdquo; Little did Paul think as he
looked at it that he would treasure that small page
as one would treasure one&rsquo;s passage to heaven.</p>

<p>Christopher arrived at the studio punctually to
the second, and found Paul ready for him. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>two turned into Oakley Street and came down towards
the Embankment. It was already past sunset,
and the houses and river were shrouded in a
soft mist. They reached the house near Swan
Walk and went up the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchessa di Corleone at home?&rdquo; asked
Christopher of the footman who opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come this way, sir,&rdquo; was the answer,
and he led them up the wide shallow stairs. He
threw open a door.</p>

<p>Paul saw a room of pale lavenders, with the
chrysanthemums like patches of sunlight. A
woman rose from a chair by the fire and came forward
to greet them. The window was behind her
as she came forward, and the room being in twilight
he could not see her face distinctly, but he saw the
outlines of her graceful figure, and caught the glint
of her red-brown hair.</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very charming of you to come and see me,
Mr. Treherne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pietro, the lights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul heard the sound of three or four tiny clickings
near the door, and the room became full of a
soft mellow light. Had the light been a trifle
brighter, or her voice a shade less natural, the whole
thing might have verged on the theatrical. As it
was, it was simply a revelation to Paul as, for the
first time, he saw the Duchessa di Corleone.</p>

<p>She stood before him smiling&mdash;a smile that just
lit up her eyes and trembled on her mouth. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>saw that her skin was smooth like ivory, that her
lips were crimson like wine beneath oiled silk, that
her hair was the colour of a chestnut newly wrested
from its sheath.</p>

<p>All this Paul saw almost without realizing it.
For suddenly his heart heard a tune&mdash;one that is
played silently throughout the ages, and to most of
us the hearing of the tune comes slowly and gradually,
a note at a time. But to a few&mdash;as to Paul&mdash;it
comes suddenly, played in full melody. He
felt vaguely that he had been waiting for that tune
all his life, listening for it on the plains, in the silence
of the night under the stars.</p>

<p>But he merely bowed and said in the most ordinary
and conventional voice in the world:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very good of you to ask me to come
and see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Paul did not yet know the meaning of the
tune. In his lonely life he had never before even
heard an imitation of it. And because the music
was very strange and very beautiful he listened to
it with something like awe.</p>

<p>And then he heard Christopher&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have told you, Sara, that Mr.
Treherne is an artist of strange moods, and that
sometimes he refuses&mdash;in the most polite and diplomatic
way, of course&mdash;to accept commissions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Duchessa looked at Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Treherne will refuse to paint
my portrait. At least I hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be honoured to paint it,&rdquo; Paul replied.</p>

<p>The words were conventional. Since he intended
to accept the commission it was very nearly
the only phrase he could have used, yet there was
something in his utterance of the words that seemed
just to lift them from the commonplace. Perhaps
it was the direct way in which he spoke them.
Paul had generally a very direct manner of speech.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Sara glanced at him, and an indefinable
something in his eyes caused an odd little movement
in her heart. The room in which they were sitting
seemed suddenly brighter, the chrysanthemums a
more beautiful colour, the logs on the fire more
than usually crackly and pleasant. For so it is
that two people who are complete strangers to each
other sometimes meet and in some subtle way, and
without realizing it at the time, the whole world
has altered for them. And the invisible gods
laughed softly, and the grim old fates smiled, and
drew two threads of their weaving, which had
hitherto had nothing to do with each other, a little
closer together.</p>

<p>Before Paul left the house on the Embankment
it was arranged that the Duchessa should come to
his studio the following morning at eleven o&rsquo;clock
for her first sitting.</p>

<span class="ph3">PRINCESS PIPPA AWAKES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ISS Mason threw a large shovelful of coal
on to the fire, then turned to Barnabas, who
was sitting astride on a chair, his arms resting on
its back, and looking at her with a slight twinkle
of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you to smile, Barnabas,&rdquo;
she said energetically, &ldquo;but if my model hadn&rsquo;t
failed me, do you suppose for one moment that I
should allow you to be sitting there wasting my
morning, and incidentally wasting your own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No waste, dear Aunt Olive,&rdquo; said Barnabas
imperturbably. He had calmly given her the title
one day, and it had been adopted by the five other
artists of the courtyard. It had pleased Miss Mason
immensely, though she occasionally pretended
to look upon it as an impertinence. &ldquo;No waste,
dear Aunt Olive. The enormous benefit I invariably
derive from your conversation is of incalculably
greater advantage to me than the time I
should otherwise spend in dabbing paint on canvas.
The canvas is always destroyed at the end of two
hours, unless the subject happens to be a commission.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>Your conversation abides for ever engraven
on my memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas, you&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; retorted Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Besides, if you were not here I should paint a
still life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oranges against a green or blue earthenware
jar&mdash;I know,&rdquo; said Barnabas sorrowfully. &ldquo;Dear
aunt, <i>cui bono</i>? You have dozens of oranges already
on canvas, to say nothing of the blue and
green jars. You could paint them in your sleep.
Why make another representation of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mock at my work,&rdquo; said Miss Mason severely.
&ldquo;You have a lifetime before you, and
can afford to waste mornings. I cannot. Remember
my age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to do so, since you wish it,&rdquo; returned
Barnabas. &ldquo;It is, however, the one thing I invariably
forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;However, if
you won&rsquo;t go, where is my knitting? I can&rsquo;t sit
entirely idle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a bundle of white woolwork from a
side table. Two steel knitting-needles were stuck
into it. She sat down in the big oak chair by the
fire, and in a moment the needles were clicking
busily. She looked more like one of the three
Fates than ever. And somewhere away in a back
street a scrap of humanity must have heard the
clicking needles, and a thread of white wool must
have stretched out invisibly to draw it towards the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>hands that held them. Though at the moment
Miss Mason knitted serenely unconscious of the
fact.</p>

<p>Barnabas watched her in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the poor?&rdquo; he asked politely, after a couple
of minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Babies,&rdquo; said Miss Mason shortly. &ldquo;They
get little enough welcome, poor mites; but knowing
that a white jacket with a bit of blue ribbon run
through it is waiting for them, helps the mothers
to look forward to their advent with a certain
degree of pleasure. It&rsquo;s curious, the effect of little
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hardly have thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Miss
Mason. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had a baby. Neither have
I, for the matter of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up and caught Barnabas&rsquo; eyes fixed
on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas, you&rsquo;re disgraceful!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I never know what I say when I begin to talk
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therein lies the charm of your conversation,&rdquo;
he assured her. &ldquo;It is always so unpremeditated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Miss Mason, and she returned to
her knitting.</p>

<p>She looked exactly the same as she had looked
six months previously, except that there was a new
and curious radiance about her eyes. They looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>as if they were absorbing happiness, and giving it
forth again in actual light. Also her black dress
had given place to a grey one.</p>

<p>The style being unprocurable at any modern
shop, she had engaged a sewing-woman to make it
for her. The woman was firmly persuaded that
Miss Mason was quite mad, but finding her an extremely
generous customer, she was perfectly ready
to seam grey cashmere into any pattern Miss Mason
might require. She had once gone so far as
to announce that the costume was picturesque.
Something in her manner as she made the statement
had annoyed Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Picturesque! Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; Miss
Mason had retorted. &ldquo;It is serviceable and comfortable,
and suited to a woman of my age. Some
women of sixty make fools of themselves in a
couple of yards of silk nineteen inches wide. I
make a fool of myself in twelve yards of cashmere
forty inches wide. That&rsquo;s all the difference. But
I prefer my own folly.&rdquo; And the sewing-woman
had retired crestfallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Paul yesterday,&rdquo; remarked Barnabas
after a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; said Miss Mason succinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; returned Barnabas. &ldquo;He is so refreshingly
clean. He always looks as if he had
just completed a toilette in which baths, aromatic
soap, and hair-brushes had played an important
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he manages to escape looking shiny,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all take baths,&rdquo; went on Barnabas thoughtfully;
&ldquo;at least, I hope so. But with the majority
of people one has to take the fact of their scrupulous
cleanliness more on faith than by sight. With
Paul it is so extraordinarily apparent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he doing at the moment?&rdquo; asked Miss
Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Painting the portrait of a certain Duchessa di
Corleone. I happened to see the lady leaving the
studio. She is remarkably beautiful. Paul has
the devil&rsquo;s own luck. I have to spend my time
painting middle-aged women with hair groomed by
their maids till they look like barbers&rsquo; blocks, or
pink-cheeked girls with a perpetual smile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t paint them if you dislike doing it,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt Olive, I must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such thing. You have an excellent private
income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant you that. It is, however, not the point.
I am a portrait painter. It is my <i>mtier</i>. To be
a portrait painter one must paint portraits. The
two things are inseparable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paint models, then,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Choose your subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the same thing,&rdquo; replied Barnabas
gravely. &ldquo;A model who is paid for sitting does
not rank with a creature who pays one to immortalize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>their material features on canvas. To say I
have a model coming to sit for me this morning is
nothing. To say the Lady Mayoress of So-and-So
comes to my study at eleven o&rsquo;clock this morning is
quite another matter. At first your fellow-artists
say, &lsquo;Pure swank on his part.&rsquo; But when eleven
o&rsquo;clock arrives, and with it the Lady Mayoress in
a gold coach with four horses and velvet-breeched
lackeys with cocked hats&mdash;why, then the whole
thing assumes totally different proportions. I am
regarded in a new light. I become a person of importance
among my fellow-men. I gaze upon a
double chin, boot-button eyes, and a smile that won&rsquo;t
come off, enduring mental torture thereby, in order
that later I may strut from my studio with an air of
swagger, and hear myself spoken of as &lsquo;John Kirby,
the portrait painter.&rsquo; And once more I ask you,
how can one attain to the distinction of portrait
painter if one does not paint portraits?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas, you&rsquo;re ridiculous,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;You talk of nothing seriously, not even your art
which you love. But if you could be serious for
ten minutes, I&rsquo;d like to ask you about a scheme I
have in my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little hesitancy in the last words.
Barnabas looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m attending,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Miss Mason quietly, &ldquo;that
for a woman who spends as little as I do I am very
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Barnabas nodded. &ldquo;I thought you must have
a good bit of money,&rdquo; he said, glancing round the
studio.</p>

<p>Miss Mason followed the direction of his glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was rather&mdash;what you would call a
splurge&mdash;on my part,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Fact
is, I have about fifteen thousand a year. If I spend
two in the year it will be all I shall do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barnabas gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; went on Miss Mason, growing
gruffer as she became more in earnest, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
you how much I care for art. Suppose I inherited
the love of it from my father. See now, it&rsquo;s little
use loving it if one doesn&rsquo;t get the chance to work
when one&rsquo;s young&mdash;I mean as far as one&rsquo;s own
creation is concerned. Get a lot of pleasure dabbing
paint on canvas, making pictures of oranges,
and drawing charcoal heads. But the time&rsquo;s past
for me to do anything serious in that line. Glad
you&rsquo;re honest enough not to contradict me. Been
thinking, though, that there must be others who
would like the chance. Care so much myself, would
like to help them.&rdquo; She stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ripping idea,&rdquo; said Barnabas warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought,&rdquo; went on Miss Mason, &ldquo;that if five
thousand pounds a year went for that purpose it&rsquo;d
be something&mdash;give twenty would-be artists the
chance, anyhow. Each would-be artist to have an
income of two hundred and fifty pounds for five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>years while they are studying&mdash;longer if you
thought well. Then another to take their place.
Want them to be people who&rsquo;d really care. Love
the work. Want you to help me. Don&rsquo;t rush the
matter. If you can find the right people let me
know. You&rsquo;re a young man. Would like to appoint
you as my executor in the scheme. You
could carry on the work. Would like, though, to
see it started.&rdquo; Miss Mason looked anxiously at
Barnabas. The little speech had cost her a great
effort. It was the outcome of the thought of many
weeks.</p>

<p>Barnabas met her look. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I
should like better than to help you in the scheme,&rdquo;
he said warmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. By Jingo! Twenty
men to have their chance every five years. Think
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am ready to include women too,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason, &ldquo;as long as&rdquo;&mdash;she continued, getting
gruffer than ever&mdash;&ldquo;they aren&rsquo;t giving up other
duties to it. Might find some women glad to have
a chance too. Would have liked it myself. You
go about among people. Can let me know later.
Don&rsquo;t rush it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Barnabas again. &ldquo;Aunt Olive,
you&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boyish compliment brought the colour to
Miss Mason&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you like the idea,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>A sudden gust of wind tore round the studio,
and a torrential shower, half of sleet, half of hail,
beat down upon the skylight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abominable weather!&rdquo; said Miss Mason, clicking
her knitting-needles furiously. She did not
even now guess how near to her the scrap of humanity
had been drawn by the thread of white wool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have much for which to be thankful,&rdquo; began
Barnabas piously, &ldquo;a blazing fire, a roof&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His further reflections were interrupted by a
knock on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See who it is, will you?&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Sally is busy. If it is a beggar send him or her
away. I don&rsquo;t encourage them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas grinned broadly, knowing the untruth
of the statement. He heaved himself off the chair
and went towards the door.</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s parley. Then he returned,
followed by a small and weird figure. Its
sex was indistinguishable. A man&rsquo;s coat frayed
and torn reached to the top of a pair of patched
boots many sizes too large for the feet they covered,
a man&rsquo;s slouched hat hid nearly the whole of
the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It says it is a model,&rdquo; announced Barnabas.
&ldquo;Its language is a mixture of French and broken
English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason let her knitting fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A model!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking at the odd
creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>The figure in the old coat saw the fire. It made
an instant dart towards it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The sigh was one of intense satisfaction.
The hands, hidden by the frayed coat-sleeves,
were held out towards the leaping flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cold?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason quickly.</p>

<p>The figure nodded its head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who sent you to me?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personne. But I know Keetie Jenkins &rsquo;as been
model for you. She tell me you ask &rsquo;er when you
bring ze baby ze white jacket. Mrs. Jenkins &rsquo;as
taken Keetie away, so I tink I do instead of Keetie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grunted Miss Mason. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen
you yet. So the Jenkinses have gone, have they?
That accounts for Kitty failing me this morning.
They might have taken the trouble to let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The small figure by the fire raised its head quickly.
Miss Mason and Barnabas had a glimpse of a
pointed chin and a scarlet mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jenkins she is too un&rsquo;appy. You see
Georgie &rsquo;e is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgie! Never heard of him. Who was
he?&rdquo; demanded Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Er little boy.&rdquo; The reply came seriously.
&ldquo;&rsquo;E die of doing too many lessons. Mrs. Jenkins
say Keetie not die zat way. She &rsquo;as gone to ze
country, where ze &rsquo;spectors not so &rsquo;ticular, she say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A unique death,&rdquo; remarked Barnabas gravely.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy many little boys die of that complaint.
Have you ever posed before?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mais, oui.&rdquo; The head was nodded vigorously.
&ldquo;Sall I pose for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re like yet,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a proverb, O infant,&rdquo; supplemented
Barnabas, &ldquo;which instructs one never to buy a pig
in a poke. Acting on that principle, it is impossible
for us to decide on a model attired as you are.
Therefore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my tings,&rdquo; she nodded gravely. &ldquo;I take
zem off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figure tossed the slouched hat on to a chair.
It was followed by the coat and the boots, which
later were kicked off, disclosing bare feet small and
well-arched.</p>

<p>There stood before them a slip of a girl-child,
in a faded green frock, black hair cut square on the
forehead and at the nape of the neck, after the fashion
of some medival page, the face white, with
pointed chin and geranium-coloured mouth, eyes
grey with pupils large and very black. She might
have been about nine years old.</p>

<p>She raised her hands to the back of her neck, unfastening
mysterious strings. Before Miss Mason
was aware of her intention, she slid suddenly out of
her clothes and stood on the hearthrug before them,
naked as the day on which she was born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien?</i>&rdquo; she queried.</p>

<p>Miss Mason gave a faint shriek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barnabas, turn your back and leave the studio
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>at once. I never paint a nude model. It is against
all my principles to do so. Put on your clothes
again at once, child. Barnabas, stop laughing. I
know you&rsquo;re perfectly brazen on the subject. Remember,
in spite of my age, I&rsquo;m an unmarried
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas picked up a piece of scarlet silk drapery
from the model stand and flung it round the child,
who was looking from him to Miss Mason in astonishment.
When she was enveloped in its folds he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason, my child, is not used to seeing little
girls in their birthday attire. It surprised her. She
has a penchant for petticoats and frocks, to say
nothing of stockings. She might, however, be persuaded
to paint you draped as you now are. You
look, by the way, uncommonly like a scarlet poppy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child looked gravely at Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She not paint se altogezzer?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely. She does not paint what the immortal
Trilby termed &lsquo;the altogether,&rsquo; which phrase you
have just made your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mais, oui. Some peoples zey do not. I hear
Monsieur Thiery say one time it <i>toute  fait extraordinaire</i>
zat some peoples &rsquo;shamed to look at ze
greatest &rsquo;andiwork of God. I did not know, me,
zat ze peoples who live in ze <i>vrais ateliers</i> zey tink
it shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all have our little prejudices,&rdquo; said Barnabas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>lightly. &ldquo;Naked little girls is apparently one
of Miss Mason&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled whimsically at that lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we paint this infant?&rdquo; he asked her.
&ldquo;Can the woolly jackets be put on one side, and
may I fetch my palette?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Miss Mason shortly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
nice of you not to laugh at my prejudices, Barnabas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are moments when I rather like them,&rdquo;
he assured her. And he vanished from the studio.</p>

<p>When he returned it was to find Miss Mason
kneeling by a low chair on which the child was
seated. The red silk was off the shoulders, and
Miss Mason was sponging an ugly bruise on the
child&rsquo;s back. She turned her head as Barnabas entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; she said in a low, indignant voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; asked Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some brute she calls Mrs. Higgins.&rdquo; Miss Mason&rsquo;s
voice augured ill for that lady, had she been
at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. &rsquo;iggins drunk,&rdquo; said the child patiently.
&ldquo;She often drunk. Ver&rsquo; drunk last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason put some ointment on the bruise, and
covered it with a piece of soft linen. Then she
wrapped the red silk again round the child. She sat
down in the big chair and drew the child to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, little one,&rdquo; she said, speaking in French,
&ldquo;tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the child rapturously, &ldquo;you speak
French.&rdquo; Her face had gone crimson with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us everything,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>It came then, an odd little story, scrappily told.
Her name was Pippa. She had lived in Paris with
Madame Barbin. Madame Barbin washed clothes
till they were white&mdash;oh, but very white. Pippa
had posed for artists. She loved Madame Barbin,
but she had died&mdash;a year, perhaps two years, ago.
Madame Fournier had taken care of her then. She
did not like Madame Fournier, who was cross.
Then Madame Fournier had brought her in a ship
to England. Perhaps that was a year ago. Anyhow,
it was cold weather. They had lived in different
houses, and finally at Mrs. Higgins&rsquo; house,
and Pippa had posed for different artists in London.
Some time in the summer, Madame Fournier had
gone away, leaving Pippa with Mrs. Higgins. She
had not come back. Mrs. Higgins was angry&mdash;very
angry, according to Pippa. She beat her occasionally,
but not always very badly. Bruises were
likely to be seen on one who poses for &ldquo;the altogether.&rdquo;
Lately, however, Mrs. Higgins had been
too angry to remember that fact. Hence the bruises
of the previous evening. In reply to further questioning
it was found that Pippa knew no one she
had ever called father or mother. There were only
Madame Barbin, Madame Fournier, Mrs. Higgins,
and the names of quite a good many well-known artists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>for whom she had posed. She also stated that
she washed herself every morning, though Mrs.
Higgins said it was &ldquo;un&rsquo;ealthy.&rdquo; And she washed
and dried her underclothes when Mrs. Higgins was
away at the public-houses, where she spent most of
her time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss Mason nodded. &ldquo;The child is
clean, at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then suddenly at the end of the recital, Pippa
swayed a little sideways, and if Barnabas had not
sprung forward she would have fallen on the hearthrug.
As it was, she lay in his arms, her face dead
white against the scarlet folds of silk. In a word,
Pippa had fainted.</p>

<p>Barnabas laid her flat on the hearthrug and
opened the door and windows. Miss Mason fetched
brandy and a large cut-glass bottle of smelling-salts,
which she held to the child&rsquo;s nose, making a curious
clucking sound with her tongue, and lamenting
that there were no feathers handy to burn. But
presently, in spite of the lack of feathers, Pippa
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Then Barnabas put a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you last have food?&rdquo; he asked,
watching her.</p>

<p>Pippa put up a small hand to her forehead and
pushed back the dark hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; she said feebly. &ldquo;Bread and
treacle&rdquo;&mdash;she rolled the r&rsquo;s in a funny way&mdash;&ldquo;at
dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And nothing since then!&rdquo; cried Miss Mason
in horror. &ldquo;Oh! that Mrs. Higgins!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Barnabas was already in the kitchen issuing
commands to Sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bread, Sally, quick. Cut it in small pieces and
put them in a saucepan with lots of milk. Is there
a good fire? Yes. Ever made bread and milk in
your life before?&rdquo; And Sally flew round.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Barnabas and Miss Mason were
feeding a small famished girl, who was looking at
them as if they were gods from another world, and
at the bread and milk as if it were the nectar and
ambrosia they had brought with them.</p>

<p>And when the blue basin was empty Barnabas
lifted Pippa in his arms, and guided by Miss Mason,
carried her into the inner room, and laid her like a
little broken poppy in Miss Mason&rsquo;s bed. Together
they tucked her in, and saw the white eyelids close
slowly over the great grey eyes.</p>

<p>Then they went out into the studio. And Barnabas
threw the man&rsquo;s coat and hat, and the old boots
into a corner. The other garments he put on the
model stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come back by and by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
see how the small creature is getting on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked in twice during the day to find that
she was still asleep. It was after sunset when he
came the third time, and it was to find her sitting
near the fire eating a delicious brown egg and slices
of bread and butter, while Miss Mason was telling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>her that most entrancing of fairy tales&mdash;&ldquo;The
Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas sat down and waited. Every now and
then he looked at the child with a puzzled expression
in his eyes. Suddenly he threw back his head. He
very nearly whistled. Something that had eluded
him had been discovered.</p>

<p>The egg and the story were finished. There
came a silence.</p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s eyes wandered round the studio.
They lighted on the faded green dress lying on the
model stand. A queer little look of sadness that
should be foreign to a child&rsquo;s face crept back into
her eyes.</p>

<p>She slid down from her chair, and stood solemnly
before Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tank you bof ver&rsquo; much,&rdquo; she said, with a
quaint air of courtesy. &ldquo;But now I put on zem
tings and go back to Mrs. &rsquo;iggins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled a brave little smile, sadder than any
tears or protests.</p>

<p>Barnabas felt a sudden odd grip at his throat.
Miss Mason spoke suddenly and firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are not going back to Mrs.
Higgins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child looked at her with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you are going to stay here with me,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason decisively. &ldquo;Barnabas, you must help
me to arrange it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s face quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, with a laugh that held a sob,
&ldquo;I tink I like dat Princess. She sleep and sleep,
and she wake up when ze Prince kiss her, and ze
world all ver&rsquo; &rsquo;appy. And I so &rsquo;appy just all ze
same, wisout no Prince kiss me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Barnabas did a queer thing. He put
his arm round the child and kissed her lips.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="ph3">AT THE WORLD&rsquo;S END</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ARELY half an hour after Miss Mason&rsquo;s sudden
decision Barnabas set out for a small and
rather unwholesome street somewhere in the direction
of the World&rsquo;s End. It was given by Pippa as
the locality in which Mrs. Higgins had her residence.</p>

<p>It was not entirely on Miss Mason&rsquo;s account that
Barnabas was anxious to make further enquiries
regarding the child. As he walked along the King&rsquo;s
Road, with its pavement slippery and muddy from
the feet of many passers-by, his mind travelled back
to memories which Pippa&rsquo;s face had awakened in
him.</p>

<p>They were memories some fourteen or fifteen
years old, of the time when he was a young art student.
A scene he had almost forgotten came clearly
back to him. He saw a big class-room full of
easels and men working and smoking. He saw
himself, very young, very full of enthusiasm, yet at
the moment very full of despair. He saw himself
looking with disgust at his own somewhat feeble
attempt to reproduce on canvas the figure of the
nude model who was standing on the platform before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>him. He saw the master coming near, and
heard his words. They were few but sarcastic.
He had felt that the whole room was listening to
them. First an insane desire to sink into the floor
had overwhelmed him, then a feeling that he had
better take his canvas and brushes and fling them
into the river. It had been mere presumption on
his part to dream of art as a career. He had seen
the other figures in the room through a kind of
hazy blur. The voice of the master as he went
from easel to easel had come to him as through
cotton-wool. He did not notice that almost equally
sarcastic remarks were being levelled at the other
canvases, and were being received by their owners
with indifference or with good-humoured laughter.
He had heard the door close presently as the master
left the room. Then he heard a voice at his elbow&mdash;a
curiously musical voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity Saltby looks upon sarcasm in the
light of instruction in art. He can paint quite decently
himself, but he has no more notion of teaching
than a tom cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas remembered that he had turned to look
at the speaker, and had seen a dark foreign-looking
man standing beside him. The man had looked at
him sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fellow has worried you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just calling rest. Come along out and
have a smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas remembered following him into the corridor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>He remembered the curious feeling of restful
strength the man had given him as they walked
up and down together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you a bit of advice,&rdquo; he had
said suddenly. &ldquo;Remember this, that the opinion
of one man, even if he happens to be your master,
counts for nothing. The moment you touch any
art&mdash;painting, sculpture, music, or literature&mdash;you&rsquo;re
laying yourself open to criticism, and you&rsquo;ll
find any amount of it adverse. Don&rsquo;t let it discourage
you. If you&rsquo;ve got the inner conviction
that you can do something, forge ahead and do it.
Don&rsquo;t be damped by adverse criticism. If you can
learn from it, learn; but don&rsquo;t let it kill the germ
of belief in yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t one be mistaken in the belief that one
can do something?&rdquo; Barnabas remembered asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are mistaken you&rsquo;ll find it out for yourself,&rdquo;
the man had replied earnestly. &ldquo;My dear
boy, the men who can&rsquo;t, and never will, do anything
are those who are so cocksure of themselves that
they are impervious to sarcasm and every adverse
criticism under the sun. It simply doesn&rsquo;t hurt
them. It does hurt us. It touches us on the raw.
But we&rsquo;ve got to go on. You felt like chucking
the whole thing just now. I&rsquo;ll be bound it wasn&rsquo;t
exactly that your self-vanity was wounded, but because
you felt that it had been utterly presumptuous
of you ever to have attempted to lift your eyes to
the Immortal Goddess. My dear boy, she loves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>men to look at her and worship her, from however
far off. It&rsquo;s those who say they are paying her
homage, but who all the time are looking at and
worshipping themselves, for whom she has no use.
Go on worshipping her. Keep big ideas before you
and one day you may get near the foot of her
throne. It&rsquo;s not given to many to touch her knees.
But to worship at the foot of the throne is something.
Why, even to look at her from afar is worth
years of struggle. Saltby keeps one eye on her I
grant, but he keeps the other on himself, and it
makes him the damned conceited and sarcastic ass
he is....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas seemed to hear the voice distinctly, to
feel the magnetism of the man who had spoken the
words so many years ago.</p>

<p>He remembered later in the evening hearing two
students speaking of the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kostolitz is a weird chap,&rdquo; one had said; &ldquo;mad
as a hatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spends half his time like a tramp,&rdquo; said the
other, &ldquo;going around the country and writing
poetry, and the other half in sculpting. Every now
and then he takes it into his head to come in here
and draw a bit. He says it freshens him up to see
beginners on their way to fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas remembered that Kostolitz had come
to him at the end of the morning and had suggested
their walking back to Chelsea together. It had been
the beginning of their friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s face came persistently before him
this evening as he pursued his way towards the
World&rsquo;s End.</p>

<p>Other little speeches of his returned to his mind.
&ldquo;I love colour,&rdquo; he seemed to hear him saying,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t work in paints. They aren&rsquo;t my
medium. I want to get to the solid. Give me a
lump of clay and I&rsquo;m happy. It&rsquo;s nonsense to say
there&rsquo;s only colour in actual coloured things.
There is colour in everything&mdash;words, music,
thoughts&mdash;the world&rsquo;s steeped in colour if you can
only see it. Why, man, it may seem odd to you,
but people even give me the sense of colour. Perhaps
it&rsquo;s the old Eastern idea of auras, I don&rsquo;t
know. Anyhow, that idea is too mixed up with
spiritualism and closed rooms to appeal to me.
Give me the open air, the sunshine, flowers, and
singing birds. I can believe in fairies, gnomes, the
People of the Wind, and the People of the Trees,
anything that is of the Spirit of Nature. There
they sit together&mdash;Nature and Art&mdash;the two
great goddesses, bless them; and men try to separate
Art from Nature. They can&rsquo;t, man, I tell you
they can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas could almost see the man&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;passionate
grey eyes&mdash;fixed on him as he remembered
the words. And it was the memory of those eyes
that Pippa&rsquo;s eyes had awakened in him, and with
their memory had brought the other scenes before
him. The memory had awakened as he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>watched her listening entranced to the story of
&ldquo;The Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo; He had seen the eyes of
his friend Kostolitz looking at him from the small
pale face, and suddenly he had seen the whole wonderful
likeness the child bore to the man. Kostolitz
was dead, had been dead now many years. Had
he left behind him this scrap of humanity, holding
perhaps a spirit as poetical and intense as his own,
to battle with the world? If it were so, for the
sake of that friendship, it must be protected. And
something told Barnabas that he was not mistaken
in his belief.</p>

<p>He turned now into the small dark street. He
found the house whose number Pippa had given
him, and knocked on the door. It was opened by
a large, slatternly woman with a watery eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you, Pippa?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, you
come in, and I&rsquo;ll give you somethink staying hout
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she saw Barnabas. Visions of N.S.P.C.C.
inspectors rose suddenly before her mind. Mrs.
Higgins quailed inwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, and her voice was truculent
because her spirit was quaking, &ldquo;and wot can I do
for you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I,&rdquo; asked Barnabas suavely, &ldquo;addressing
Mrs. Higgins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my nime,&rdquo; replied the lady, arms
akimbo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; continued Barnabas, still suavely,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>&ldquo;that you have had charge of a child&mdash;a little
girl named Pippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Mrs. Higgins defiantly, &ldquo;and a
more hungrateful, huntruthful, little baggage I
hain&rsquo;t never set heyes on. Hif you &rsquo;ave hanythink
to say about &rsquo;er, per&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;ll kindly step hinside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas stepped into the small passage. It was
ill-smelling, redolent of dirt and boiled cabbage.
Mrs. Higgins herself breathed gin. She was, however,
at the moment tolerably sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;that she came
here with a Madame Fournier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Higgins blazed. &ldquo;She did. A French
&rsquo;uzzy wot took and disappeared last June, leaving
me with &rsquo;er child. Friend&rsquo;s child she called it. I
know them gimes. Just about as much a friend&rsquo;s
child as Madame &rsquo;ad a right to &rsquo;er title or &rsquo;er ring
wot she wore so conspikus, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Leaving
me with the child on me &rsquo;ands, wot I kep&rsquo; from
charity, and never so much has a penny piece to
pay for &rsquo;er keep but wot she gets from them hartists
as she goes to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the child,&rdquo; asked Barnabas, &ldquo;is no relation
of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Relation of mine!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Higgins indignantly
and virtuously. &ldquo;Do yer think hif she belonged
to me as I&rsquo;d allow &rsquo;er to be standing naked
fer men to look at. I&rsquo;m a respectable woman, I am,
I thanks the Halmighty.&rdquo; Mrs. Higgins ended
with a loud sniff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Barnabas suddenly felt a sensation of almost
physical nausea. He seemed to hear Kostolitz&rsquo;s
voice begging him to leave the place, to get away
from the filth of the atmosphere, and above all
never to let the child return to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Barnabas decisively, &ldquo;you will no
doubt be glad to be relieved from the burden of
maintaining her. She will not return here, and she
will be provided for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Higgins gasped at the suddenness of the
statement. She felt something like dismay. She
saw Pippa&rsquo;s earnings, which had added largely to
her weekly income, disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow about the hexpense I&rsquo;ve been put
to!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t feed a growing
child for six months fer nothink, and me as kind
to &rsquo;er as hif I&rsquo;d been &rsquo;er own mother.&rdquo; Mrs. Higgins
began to sob here, moved to tears by the memory
of her own tenderness.</p>

<p>Barnabas&rsquo; mouth set grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Mrs. Higgins,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that the
less you say about your treatment of the child
the better. As far as her keep is concerned her
own earnings have no doubt paid you more than
adequately for the food you have given her. As
however you will lose them in the future&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled two sovereigns from his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take these,&rdquo; he said briefly, &ldquo;and good
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned from the house leaving Mrs. Higgins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>gaping and astonished. It is a mercy when the
Mrs. Higginses of the world can be thus easily
disposed of.</p>

<p>Barnabas walked away down the street, marvelling
at the fact that man had originally been created
by God in His own image.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He went straight back to studio number seven,
where he found Miss Mason anxiously awaiting
him. He sat down and gave her a brief account
of his search and its results, omitting, however,
a description of the dirt and smells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he ended, smiling, &ldquo;you mean to keep
this waif?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let her go,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Did
you see her eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas had. But the look in them had hurt
him too much for him to care to think about it.
So he merely said lightly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asleep on half a dozen cushions and among
blankets on the floor of my room. She has had
a bath and been wrapped again in that red silk.
She&rsquo;ll have to live in it till I can get her some more
clothes. I&rsquo;ve burnt the others, and put the hat,
coat, and boots in the dust hole. In spite of her
poor little attempts at cleanliness, one never knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One does not,&rdquo; said Barnabas grimly, thinking
of the house she had come from. &ldquo;May I smoke?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. She liked the
scent of tobacco in her studio. She felt it to be
part and parcel of Bohemia.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>Miss Mason was thinking of the child lying
asleep in the next room. She had an odd feeling
that the Fates had sent Pippa directly to her that
she might in a way atone to herself for her own
lonely childhood by making this morsel of humanity
happy. She had already begun to weave the
dreams that are woven by fairy godmothers.</p>

<p>And Barnabas&rsquo; thoughts had again travelled back
to his friend Kostolitz, and the thoughts made his
eyes grave and a little sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going over to Paris to-morrow,&rdquo; he said
suddenly, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that oil-portrait that hangs by my
mantelpiece?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a likeness
strike you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked up. She felt suddenly a
little anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I never thought
of it before. It&rsquo;s the image of Pippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it when I came back into the studio and
found her at tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the portrait?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man I knew long ago,&rdquo; said Barnabas.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>&ldquo;His name was Philippe Kostolitz. He was a
strange man&mdash;an Hungarian. He was a true
vagabond, yet certainly of good birth. I knew
nothing of his people, if he had any. He was half
gipsy and wholly artist. The statue of the little
faun in my garden is his work. He gave it to me.
We were great friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Miss Mason softly. &ldquo;And where is
he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas made a swift sign of the cross. He
had been baptized a Catholic, and in spite of his
present rather Pagan views regarding life he had
retained this beautiful custom. There was an innate
instinct of reverence in Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Paradise I hope. He was killed nine years
ago in a railway accident. It was a horribly prosaic
ending for a man whose whole nature was
the essence of poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason was silent. After a moment she
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you think that Pippa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off.
She was looking straight at Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;The likeness
is extraordinary. In Paris I might find out something
from the artists for whom she posed. I know
one or two of them personally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;The journey,
of course, will be my affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;is pure nonsense. If
Pippa&mdash;you see, Kostolitz was my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish it,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. And something
in her voice made Barnabas give way.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or so later he left the studio.</p>

<p>Before Miss Mason put out her light that night
she went across to the heap of cushions and blankets
and looked at Pippa. She touched her cheek
gently with one wrinkled hand. It was long before
Miss Mason slept. She lay awake listening to the
regular sound of the child&rsquo;s breathing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning, with the variability of English
weather, broke still and sunny, a touch of frost in
the air.</p>

<p>Barnabas looked in at Miss Mason&rsquo;s studio before
he left for Paris.</p>

<p>He found that lady sitting in her chair knitting.
Pippa was curled up on the hearthrug, the red silk
tightly swathing her slim body. A pair of shoes
and stockings of Sally&rsquo;s, many sizes too big for
her, covered her feet. She was watching Miss
Mason with the eyes of an adoring puppy.</p>

<p>She scrambled to her feet as she saw Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, a note of great pleasure in her
voice. &ldquo;It is ze so sunny Monsieur. I wis you
good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas came over and stood on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just off,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d look in,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;I
waited for you before going out to buy garments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going away?&rdquo; asked Pippa, looking at him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>with troubled eyes. She had had experience of
people who went away and did not return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for a few days, and mainly on business
which concerns you, little one,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>Pippa gave a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back ver&rsquo; quick,&rdquo; she said. And then
suddenly: &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;You must call me Barnabas,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>She nodded her head. &ldquo;Monsieur Barnabas,&rdquo;
she said slowly. Then she turned to Miss Mason
&ldquo;What sall I call you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>A sudden little tender thought sprang into Miss
Mason&rsquo;s mind. She put it aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can call me,&rdquo; she said rather gruffly,
&ldquo;Aunt Olive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the child nodded her head. &ldquo;Aunt Oleeve
and Monsieur Barnabas, c&rsquo;est bon.&rdquo; She looked an
odd little elfin figure as she stood there watching
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time
to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa came to the door with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bon voyage,&rdquo; she cried, waving her hand.
And then suddenly she saw the marble faun in the
next garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Quel beau petit garon!&rdquo;
She darted down one path and up another.</p>

<p>The last thing Barnabas saw, as he looked back
before leaving the courtyard, was a poppy-coloured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>figure standing in the wintry sunshine beside a
white marble faun. The child had her arms familiarly
round the faun&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>He painted that picture later when the days were
warmer. It was a picture that was to travel far
away from England, and it was to keep alive in
the heart of a woman the memory of a secret&mdash;a
secret of three weeks of glorious happiness and
a strange regret&mdash;a secret known only to herself
and to three other living people.</p>

<span class="ph3">VARIOUS MATTERS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND so Barnabas departed to Paris in the attempt
to find some clue regarding the scrap of
humanity which the Fates had led to Miss Mason&rsquo;s
studio. It was not that Miss Mason cared in the
smallest degree what her parentage was. She was
just a lonely little soul needing love, and so Miss
Mason had taken her into her arms and into her
big heart. Dan had once said of Miss Mason, and
only shortly after making her acquaintance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I veritably believe that woman has the biggest
hands, the biggest feet, and the biggest heart of
any woman in Christendom.&rdquo; And the more he
knew of her the more convinced he felt of the truth
of his statement.</p>

<p>But even a big heart is not entirely sufficient
guarantee for taking possession of a small girl.
One can no more pick one up and keep it than one
can pick up a valuable ornament and place it on
one&rsquo;s mantelpiece. At any rate, if one did there
would always be the uncomfortable feeling that the
rightful owner might one day walk casually up to
it and say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Barnabas understood this, and therefore he had
gone off to Paris to see if there were any likelihood
of a rightful owner turning up one day to claim
Pippa. It was wiser that Miss Mason should not
get too attached to her possession before he had
made sure on that point. Also there was the
memory of Philippe Kostolitz.</p>

<p>But while he was gone Miss Mason petted the
child to her heart&rsquo;s content, bought dainty undergarments
and charming frocks, and played that delightful
game of &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; which is a game all
women have played throughout eternity at some
time in their lives, even if it is only played with a
rag doll wrapped in a shawl.</p>

<p>And while she was playing, and while Pippa
was enjoying the game almost as much as she was
and revelling in frilly petticoats, long black
stockings, buckled shoes, and soft green frocks&mdash;green
seemed to belong to her, for some reason,
as a matter of course&mdash;the other five artists of the
courtyard were living their lives, painting their
pictures, smoking their pipes, and being happy or
miserable according to their moods.</p>

<p>And it is perhaps safe to say, though a great pity
to have to say it, that Jasper&rsquo;s mood of the last
six months had been one of utter depression.</p>

<p>At first, when he had walked away from the
ugly little house in Chiswick, he had felt&mdash;in spite
of the shock he had received at Bridget&rsquo;s unexpected
attitude towards him&mdash;a certain exultation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>in the thought that duty would never compel him
to take that route again. He told himself that he
rejoiced in his freedom, but after a day or so he
had found it necessary to emphasize that point
to himself with a certain degree of insistence.
Phrases she had used began to return to his mind
at odd moments. In the midst of painting an
angel&rsquo;s wing, or trying to concentrate on the
beatific expression of some saint&rsquo;s face, he would
suddenly hear her voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask your help, to tell you what
I had suffered. I could not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again, when painting some piece of flame-coloured
drapery, he would hear the words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you try to help me? By talking
calm platitudes through a kind of moral disinfectant
sheet which you held between us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yet again, as he tried for the strength of
courage in the face of the warrior angel, he would
hear her saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not had the manhood to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It angered him that she should come between
him and his work. He had loved it. He had felt
a kind of mystical joy in it, in the knowledge
that his work would adorn the houses of God,
and that the saints he painted would look down
upon the altar where the priest commemorated
the Great Sacrifice. Sometimes in his more
intense moments he had fancied himself an
incarnation of one of the old painters who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>portrayed for sheer love of God dancing saints
garlanded with flowers. He did not know that
his own work lacked that child-like joy, and that
its asceticism was hard and cold.</p>

<p>But now the memory of the house in Chiswick,
which he used to banish easily from his thoughts,
came again and again before his mind to prevent
him working. He began to leave his studio and
go for long walks, only returning when it was too
dark to paint. And his fellow-artists wondered
what possessed him, and would have welcomed
one of his priggish speeches rather than this
moody silence.</p>

<p>And Alan Farley, the other artist who fancied
himself a mystic, painted a few pictures when the
inspiration was upon him, pictures which remained
to adorn his own studio walls, as they
were incomprehensible to any one but himself
and to one other&mdash;a girl, Aurora Castleton, in
whom Alan found a kindred soul. They frequented
each other&rsquo;s studios, and talked of &ldquo;the
true spirit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the deeper meaning,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
virtue of symbolism,&rdquo; and lamented that the public
were too blind to realize the inner beauty
which they were kindly interpreting for them on
canvas. They found, however, a great deal of
consolation and pleasure in each other&rsquo;s society.
And a Small Boy with drooping wings sat mournfully
in a corner and heard them talk, knowing
that he alone could give them the true key to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>meaning of Beauty&mdash;a key that the most ignorant
could understand. But they refused to look at
him. Even his arrows were useless, for the cloak
of High Art with which the two had surrounded
themselves seems to be the one thing that is
impervious to them.</p>

<p>And Dan plodded on with his Messonier-like
paintings and missed Barnabas a good deal, in
spite of the fact that he had been gone barely
three days. And Michael did wonderful line
work, and wrote little cynical essays for a small
magazine that scoffed at love as sentimental.</p>

<p>But Paul was absorbed in his portrait of the
Duchessa, and in the wonderful music his heart
heard, the meaning of which was beginning to
dawn on his soul.</p>

<p>The Duchessa had given him her own ideas
regarding the portrait the first morning she had
come to the studio. She had told him about the
Casa di Corleone, and the courtyard with the
golden oranges and marble fauns and nymphs,
and the gallery where her portrait was to hang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want it,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;to be a wee bit&mdash;just
the weest bit in the world&mdash;flaunting. The
women of the House of Corleone are haughty and
disdainful. They are too proud to show their
feelings. If they ever loved the courtyard and the
sunshine, they would have scorned to show it.
They have scorned me often for loving it. I
have seen&mdash;you may laugh at me if you like&mdash;their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>lips curl when my heart has danced for joy
as I have stood in the gallery and watched the
sunlight stream through the big hall door.
I can&rsquo;t hang there meekly accepting their scorn.
I want to defy them. They may think the place
theirs, and be calmly satisfied in their possession
of it, and they may look upon me as an alien.
But it is mine, mine, mine. I want them to know
it&mdash;not aggressively, you realize&mdash;but with just
the tiniest bit of assurance that there&rsquo;s no mistake
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Paul had responded to her mood as a
violin responds to the master-hand that draws the
bow across its strings. He had sketched her in on
the canvas almost as she had spoken the words,
standing there with her head just a trifle thrown
back, a little gleam of fascinating devilry in her
eyes.</p>

<p>They had nearly come to loggerheads regarding
her dress, however. She wished it to be scarlet,
in contrast to the black dresses and sombre
colours of the haughty ladies already in the
gallery. Paul wished it to be blue. In the end
she had had her will. It was not often that Sara,
Duchessa di Corleone, failed in accomplishing it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most noticeable characteristic of
Sara was her vivid magnetism. Every separate
burnished hair of her head seemed to possess it.
Her eyes possessed it, her smile possessed it, her
voice&mdash;a low contralto&mdash;possessed it. Her presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>dominated a room the moment she entered
it, even if she did not speak a word, and Sara
possessed a curious gift for silences. They were
sudden and unaccountable silences, more disconcerting
and full of magnetism than speech.
She lapsed into them often with Paul. They
came as a sudden and odd interruption to her
flow of sparkling talk. She had a trick of making
the most ordinary words sparkle. Water, after
all, is only water, but it can look very different in
sunshine from beneath a grey sky.</p>

<p>And perhaps for the first time Paul found
himself at a loss to read the character she presented
to him. Probably because he could not
appreciate it sufficiently calmly. The music in
his heart distracted him, and the tune was clearer
and sweeter when she was near. He knew its
meaning now, and it filled him with happiness
and pain&mdash;happiness because it is the most
beautiful music in the world to those who hear
it, and pain because it somehow seemed to
emphasize his own loneliness. And because he
had always been lonely a certain feeling had come
to him of being not wanted. It was not exactly
diffidence, not the outcome of shyness, but merely
a certainty that he made no difference to the
scheme of happiness in others; in fact, that it
probably worked more easily without him.
He could not imagine himself as essential to
anyone, and never in his wildest dreams could he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>have imagined himself as essential to the woman
who had suddenly become the centre of his
universe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One evening Barnabas returned and walked into
Miss Mason&rsquo;s studio. He came right over to the
fire and sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, looking at him very
anxiously. The game of &ldquo;mother&rdquo; can gain an
extraordinary fascination in a very few days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found out one thing,&rdquo; said Barnabas,
&ldquo;that is a curious coincidence at all events. The
child&rsquo;s real name is Philippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Miss Mason slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to different studios,&rdquo; went on Barnabas,
&ldquo;but the artists knew nothing beyond the
fact that the child had lived with Madame Barbin.
Then I went to the houses she had tenanted.
The neighbours told me she was a kind old soul,
and two of them at least averred that they remembered
the advent of Pippa to the house when
a baby of a few weeks old. They declare that
an English lady brought her to Madame Barbin,
and that Madame Barbin received money for the
child&rsquo;s keep. Madame Fournier was a relation of
Madame Barbin&rsquo;s&mdash;a niece, they believed. They
did not know where her home was beyond that
it was somewhere in Brittany. She came occasionally
to visit Madame Barbin, and was with her
when she died. Their theory is that Madame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>Fournier took possession of the child in order to
receive the allowance made for her. It was
sent to Madame Barbin, and she returned a
receipt and statement that the child was alive
and well. That, at least, is the neighbour&rsquo;s story.
But they had no notion from whom the money
came. The people who sent it must certainly
have trusted Madame Barbin implicitly. According
to the neighbours, she deserved the trust.
Madame Fournier no doubt took on the job
and abandoned the child as soon as she could
conveniently do so. To receive the money
without having to provide for the child has
evidently appealed to her mind as a method of
procedure more advantageous to herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you find out that the child&rsquo;s real
name was Philippa?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman named Madame Paulet volunteered
the information,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;She told me
that Madame Barbin had said that the child had
first been christened Philippa according to the
rites of the English Church. But being a devout
Catholic, Madame Barbin evidently didn&rsquo;t trust to
an English baptism. She had the child re-baptized.
I saw the priest who performed the ceremony.
She was then, he said, about two months old.
Madame Barbin had told him that she did not
know the name of the child&rsquo;s parents. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>received money quarterly for her maintenance.
She did tell him the name of the woman who sent
it, but as it was told under the seal of confession
he couldn&rsquo;t have given it to me even if he had
remembered it. But he had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mason slowly, &ldquo;Pippa is a
Catholic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;You are sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am old-fashioned,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;But
after all it is the same God we worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;she is Philippe&rsquo;s
child, as I believe, he would be glad. He was a
devout Catholic with a strange mixture of Paganism.
I believe that for him the altars of Pan and
Christ were built side by side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked at Barnabas with a little
twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take her to church,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Barnabas laughed. &ldquo;You think that after all
there may be some advantage in her baptism?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Then Barnabas
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Philippe were her father, and I can&rsquo;t help
feeling sure of it, he must have died some months
before her birth. Possibly before he knew that
she was even thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Miss Mason put a question, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>which had been in the minds of both of them
throughout that conversation at least, but, being a
woman, it was she who voiced it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;who was her
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>And because he had loved Philippe Kostolitz
he said no more. But his eyes again grew sad.
For Barnabas held very straight views on some
subjects, and he dreaded lest the whiteness of his
friend&rsquo;s honour had been in the smallest degree
smirched.</p>

<span class="ph3">A QUESTION OF COLOUR</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>IPPA became part of the life of the six artists
of the courtyard, and they all wondered, if
they ever thought about the matter at all, however
they had managed to get on without her.</p>

<p>She seemed to belong in some special way to
Barnabas. That fact was one of mutual recognition.
Michael found himself stopping suddenly
in the middle of his cynical little speeches when
she was present. It is impossible to be cynical
with a child&rsquo;s eyes fixed on one, drinking in every
word. Dan kept her supplied with chocolates,
and gave her a grey kitten. Jasper painted her
a picture of the Blessed Virgin. It was the first
painting he had done for weeks past without the
memory of the house in Chiswick coming as an
interruption to his thoughts. The picture, too,
held a tenderness not seen in his previous paintings.
Paul, for a wonder, allowed her to see his
unfinished work, and found amusement in her
nave criticisms. One criticism&mdash;to be related
presently&mdash;was somewhat of a revelation. Alan
studied her deeply, saying that the innocent
unfolding of a child&rsquo;s mind was one of the greatest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>marvels of creation. Her remarks on colour
honestly interested him. And in them Barnabas
felt more than ever convinced that she was the
child of his friend Philippe Kostolitz.</p>

<p>She used to announce quite gravely that people
were like colours. Miss Mason she designated as
&ldquo;couleur de rose.&rdquo; Barnabas himself she said
was gold &ldquo;all sparkling like sunshine.&rdquo; Paul
she insisted was like the purple light that fell
across the river at night. Dan was green like the
leaves of chrysanthemum foliage. Alan was the
colour of the sea. Michael was grey and red.
And she refused to assign any colour to Jasper.
But when coaxed by Barnabas she confessed it
was because he was quite grey, and no pretty colour
at all.</p>

<p>One day about the middle of February Pippa
lunched with Paul. He announced that he
wished her to see the portrait of the Duchessa di
Corleone. The Duchessa herself, who had been
away since Christmas, was coming for what would
probably be a last sitting at two o&rsquo;clock that
afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Paul, standing near the luncheon
table while Pippa gazed upon the portrait, &ldquo;what
do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa wrinkled up her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said slowly, and she came
across to the table looking at Paul with perplexed
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said Paul, a trifle disappointed,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t meet with your approval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Pippa again, still looking
puzzled. And then she saw the luncheon table.
&ldquo;Chicken and meringues&rdquo;&mdash;she rolled the &ldquo;r&rdquo;
in her funny way&mdash;&ldquo;how lovely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lunch,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;unquestionably appeals
to you far more than the portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa did not reply. But during the meal she
kept looking from the portrait to Paul, as if she
might find in his face some explanation of her
perplexity.</p>

<p>They were drinking their coffee, which Pippa
loved, when Paul&rsquo;s man announced the Duchessa.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere of the studio seemed
suddenly to sparkle with her entrance. Paul
sprang to his feet. There was a light in his eyes
of which the meanest intelligence might have
recognized the interpretation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am punctual to the moment,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And how are you? It is six weeks since we&rsquo;ve
met.&rdquo; Then she saw Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pippa,&rdquo; said Paul gravely, &ldquo;may I introduce
you to the Duchessa di Corleone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa held out her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pippa?&rdquo; queried the Duchessa, with the tiniest
and most adorable lift of her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just Pippa,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Sara sat down. &ldquo;Finish your coffee,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And may I have a cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul seized the kettle. It was the first time
she would have partaken of food or drink in his
studio. It marked, in his mind, an epoch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make fresh coffee,&rdquo; she begged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pleasure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is one of the
few achievements of which I am justly proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa was gazing at the Duchessa with wide
grey eyes. The perplexity in them had vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Pippa,&rdquo; asked Sara, &ldquo;and what do you
think of my portrait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; said Pippa firmly. &ldquo;Ze couleur
is wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, who was stirring the coffee in a jug,
paused a moment to look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colour?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

<p>Pippa nodded. &ldquo;The picture,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is
red. She&rdquo;&mdash;Pippa looked at the Duchessa&mdash;&ldquo;is
blue. Oh, but very blue, like&mdash;like zat.&rdquo;
She pointed towards a sapphire vase on Paul&rsquo;s
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Paul and Sara looked at each other. There
was the tiniest&mdash;just the very tiniest&mdash;look of
triumph in Paul&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Sara laughed outright. &ldquo;Mr. Treherne,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you longing to say &lsquo;I told you
so&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;Pippa has said it for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Sara turned to Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is the colour of the dress
that is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Pippa nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes ze dresses zey not matter,&rdquo; she
said thoughtfully, &ldquo;but for you ze real&mdash;oh, but
it hurt.&rdquo; She clasped her hands against her heart
with a little tragic gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; asked Sara as Paul
handed her the coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Re-paint the dress, and the whole portrait if
necessary,&rdquo; he replied promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the time, and your trouble!&rdquo; cried
Sara. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of it. Besides, it was
my own fault,&rdquo; she added contritely.</p>

<p>It struck neither of them as odd that they
should so implicitly accept Pippa&rsquo;s criticism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall only,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;be doing what I
originally wished to do, if you will forgive me for
saying so. The question is whether you will be
too bored with further sittings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint rose-colour stole over the ivory of the
Duchessa&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;I shall
be very happy. I have&rdquo;&mdash;she paused the
merest fraction of a second&mdash;&ldquo;not been bored at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drank her coffee and put down the cup.
Pippa got up from her chair. She knew the
moment to make herself scarce. Long acquaintance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>with studios and the work of artists had
taught her.</p>

<p>She held out her hand to the Duchessa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I like you ver&rsquo; much.
Please come to tea wis me one day&mdash;you and
Monsieur Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Duchessa, &ldquo;Christopher is
coming for me at half-past three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s face, which had been very gay, fell
suddenly. Christopher&rsquo;s name troubled him. He
was on such delightfully&mdash;for him&mdash;easy terms
with the Duchessa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But bring Monsieur Christopher too,&rdquo; said
Pippa calmly.</p>

<p>The Duchessa looked at Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where does she live?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;And may we accept this invitation wholesale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Paul assured her. &ldquo;Pippa
lives in studio number seven with Miss Mason,
don&rsquo;t you, Pippa? And we all invade that studio
at any hour. Miss Mason ties up cuts, finds new
servants for us when our old ones get out of hand,
administers hot concoctions of her own brewing
when any of us have colds, in short, mothers us
all round. And Pippa gives us excellent advice as
to the colour of our socks and ties. We really
don&rsquo;t care to think of what we were before Aunt
Olive and Pippa took us in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will come?&rdquo; said Pippa, standing near
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>Paul went over to open it for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchessa, you, and Monsieur Christopher,&rdquo;
said Pippa gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Paul, an odd inflexion in his
voice, &ldquo;no doubt Monsieur Christopher will come
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held the door open, and Pippa went out.</p>

<p>Then he came back to the Duchessa. She had
heard the inflexion in his voice, and a little light
of comprehension had sprung to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed softly to herself. Then
she looked up at Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you ready for the
metamorphosis&mdash;to re-paint me as a blue lady?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="ph3">THE LADY OF THE BLUE DRESS AGAIN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND so it was that Pippa&rsquo;s impulsive invitation
brought the lady of the blue dress once
more into Miss Mason&rsquo;s surroundings.</p>

<p>And with her advent came one of the brightest
threads which the Fates were using to weave into
the hitherto sombre pattern of her life. For
there is never any knowing what the Fates will
do. For years the woof of their weaving may be
utterly grey, but if the warp has kept firm and
strong they may suddenly take the brightest
colours&mdash;a very crazy patchwork of them&mdash;and
weave them into the most intricate and curious
pattern imaginable. And because the strength
of the warp of this life pleased them, they were
now choosing the most fantastically coloured
threads in the weaving of the woof.</p>

<p>Pippa told Miss Mason of the invitation she had
issued, and then went to wash her hands and
brush her hair. There was no need to change her
dress. She had already put on her prettiest frock
to lunch with Paul.</p>

<p>Just before half-past three there was a knock at
the door. Pippa looked up expectant. But it was
only Barnabas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, coming in and seeing the
tea-things on the table&mdash;Sally would be occupied
with hot cakes at the last moment&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re
expecting company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchessa di Corleone, Monsieur Paul, and
Monsieur Christopher,&rdquo; Pippa told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I be in the way?&rdquo; asked Barnabas,
looking at Miss Mason, &ldquo;or may I stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are never in the way,&rdquo; said Miss Mason
decisively.</p>

<p>Pippa sat down near him and slid one hand into
his. And Miss Mason looked at them, and thought
that only a year ago, and perhaps at that very
hour, she had been sitting in a stiff drawing-room
furnished with hideous chairs and ornamented
with wax flowers under glass shades, listening to
a long and minute account of Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s ill-health,
sleeplessness, and want of appetite. And
because the contrast was so very great, her eyes
grew a trifle misty with unshed happy tears, and
she said a little prayer, that was certainly more
Catholic than her distinctly Broad Church views
realized, for Miss Stanhope&rsquo;s present welfare.</p>

<p>And then suddenly voices were heard outside the
studio, a woman&rsquo;s voice which Miss Mason seemed
to recognize, and a man laughing.</p>

<p>The next moment Sally opened the door. Her
eyes were round with awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the next words were
indistinguishable&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Charlton, and Mr. Treherne,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>she gasped. Already in her mind she was
telling Jim that she had had the honour of ushering
a real live Duchess into the studio.</p>

<p>The Duchessa di Corleone came into the room.
Then she gave a little exclamation of astonishment
and went forwards with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fairy godmother!&rdquo; she cried. And she
was nearer truth than she had any idea as she spoke
the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady in the blue dress!&rdquo; said Miss Mason,
her face radiant with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you two know each other,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We met&mdash;when was it&mdash;last May?&rdquo; said
Sara. &ldquo;May I introduce Mr. Charlton.&rdquo; And
the man whom Miss Mason had seen in the lounge
of the Wilton Hotel bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the Duchessa when she was seated,
and after Barnabas had been introduced, &ldquo;quite
the most unexpected and delightful meeting.
It was not till I was on my way to Italy that I
remembered I had never asked your name.&rdquo;
And then she told the others of their first meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And has it all,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;been just as
delightful as I prophesied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More delightful,&rdquo; said Miss Mason promptly.
She was looking at Christopher. She remembered
the &ldquo;Christopher, darling,&rdquo; and her mind, woman-like,
was keen on the secret of a romance.</p>

<p>Sara saw her glance. By a flash of intuition
she guessed something of what was passing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>Miss Mason&rsquo;s mind. It gave her an opportunity
she had been looking for during the last hour and
a half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher came to fetch me that evening to
take me to an At Home, I remember. He is an
extraordinarily useful person. I have known him
since I was ten years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were addressed to Miss Mason. They
were intended for another occupant of the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Christopher, &ldquo;our first
meeting. It was, I think, unique.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchessa and her parents,&rdquo; said Christopher,
&ldquo;had taken a house in Devonshire, at
Salcombe, as a matter of fact, where I then lived.
My mother, being of a hospitable turn of mind,
and also of opinion that young men should make
themselves generally useful, sent me across the
road to enquire of Captain and Mrs. de Courcy
if I could be of any assistance to them. I went.
I found the Duchessa seated on the veranda on
an overturned flower-pot. She was engaged in
teaching &lsquo;nap&rsquo; to three small boys who had come
in from the next door garden, also with hospitable
intentions. I found Mrs. de Courcy disentangling
silver forks from among her evening frocks; they
had been packed among them for safety&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma was always under the impression
that everybody was going to steal everything,&rdquo;
interjected the Duchessa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain de Courcy,&rdquo; went on Christopher,
&ldquo;was extracting tin-tacks from the kitchen coal-scuttle,
into which they had been upset by the
Duchessa in her frantic questing for playing-cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you,&rdquo; asked Miss Mason grimly,
&ldquo;assist him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I extracted two tacks,&rdquo; continued Christopher
reminiscently. &ldquo;Then I heard the Duchessa
laugh. Have you ever heard her? I went out
on to the veranda. First I looked at her, then
I turned another flower-pot upside down and sat
upon it. I tried to instruct her in a few of the
correct rules of &lsquo;nap.&rsquo; She cheated, I remember,
abominably. She has, in fact, cheated throughout
her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I have not,&rdquo; said Sara indignantly.
There was a dimple at the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; said Christopher calmly. &ldquo;You
have cheated the Fates every time they dealt the
cards of fortune against you. It&rsquo;s a trick many
of us would give our eyes to learn. They deal
her black cards, heigh presto! the Duchessa has
changed them to red ones. They deal her low
dull cards&mdash;the Duchessa holds aces and Kings,
particularly,&rdquo; ended Christopher severely,
&ldquo;Kings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; said Sara sweetly, &ldquo;is given to
exaggeration.&rdquo; She was first the tiniest bit
annoyed. Christopher&rsquo;s last word savoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>somewhat of an accusation of flirting. No woman
cares to be accused of that pastime before a man in
whom she is feeling&mdash;well, certainly more than
just a careless interest. Besides, the music Paul
had been hearing during the last ten weeks had
begun to reach the Duchessa&rsquo;s ears, though as
yet quite faintly. The slight implication of flirting
came as a discord to the tune it was playing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The late Duca di Corleone might certainly
be termed a King,&rdquo; protested Christopher, &ldquo;while
the Casa di Corleone and the coffers of centesimi
are most assuredly many aces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the Duchessa. &ldquo;You, however,
said &lsquo;particularly Kings.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; said Christopher politely. &ldquo;I
should have said particularly aces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Duchessa made a little gracious gesture of
forgiveness. Paul had been stroking a small grey
kitten&mdash;gift of Dan to Pippa&mdash;during the little
conversation, and was apparently entirely engrossed
in the kitten. But he had heard every word, and
Christopher&rsquo;s intimacy with the Duchessa was seen
by him in a new and far more satisfactory light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said the Duchessa, addressing
herself to Miss Mason, &ldquo;I want to hear everything
you have been doing since last May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason glanced around the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a studio,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;she has adopted
six nephews and one niece.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Pippa, who was gazing at the
Duchessa with fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>Sara smiled. She looked at Paul and Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that these are two of
the nephews. Where are the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In their studios,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;Aunt
Olive doesn&rsquo;t keep all her nephews on the premises.
They are the six artists of the courtyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sara, with a low laugh, &ldquo;then you,
too, have a magic courtyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is yours?&rdquo; asked Pippa.</p>

<p>And the Duchessa told her, bringing the sunshine
of Italy and the gleam of golden oranges into the
studio, bathing it in their light and colour. And
Paul listened as he listened always when she spoke,
loving the sound of her voice and the magic of her
words.</p>

<p>Suddenly as she ended they heard the sound of
a violin. It came from across the courtyard and
through the partly open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the Duchessa, and she raised her
head listening.</p>

<p>When the last sad notes had died away, she
looked across at Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked softly, her eyes full
of tears, for the sad bitterness of a troubled heart
had wailed through the music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael Chester,&rdquo; said Paul quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; asked the Duchessa, &ldquo;is he not
taking London by storm?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;he is a cripple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Duchessa. She had no need
to ask more, for the music had told her the rest.</p>

<p>After a time she left, promising to come again.
As she went into the courtyard with Paul and
Christopher she looked towards the window from
whence the sounds of the violin had proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if one day he will play
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE DUCHESSA ENTERS A KINGDOM</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>EBRUARY gave place to a stormy March,
which ushered itself in angry and tempestuous.
By the end of the month it was tired of its anger,
and throughout April was like a child promising
with smiles and tears to be good. In May it fulfilled
its promise. The month was all sunshine,
with soft winds and blue skies. The parks were
alive with flowers, women donned their brightest
dresses, and London looked like a great living
nosegay.</p>

<p>And with the spring the Music of the Heart was
playing so loudly for the Duchessa that she
wondered Paul could not hear it too, and many
times she longed to bid him listen.</p>

<p>The portrait was finished, and was in her
drawing-room till later in the year when she would
take it with her to Italy, where it would hang in
the gallery like a great glowing sapphire among
the sombre and haughty ladies of the House of
Corleone.</p>

<p>She saw Paul from time to time. He came to
her flat, and she went to his studio. And Michael
had been persuaded to come and play for her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>And having come once he was ready to come again.
He made music sad and gay, and in her presence
it lost much of its bitterness. Only when he was
alone bitterness returned, and with it a desperate
and pathetic note of yearning. For with the
beauty of the Duchessa Michael realized more
terribly that he was not as other men, though with
the curious instinct possessed by the man-creature
of hurting himself, he loved to be near her and look
at her. And in his heart he laughed cynically at
Paul, seeing that he had but to put out his hand
and grasp the wonderful jewel of her love. But
having been lonely all his own life he understood
better than anyone Paul&rsquo;s hesitation, even while he
laughed.</p>

<p>And one day when the morning sunshine was
more radiant than ever, and the whole earth
seemed singing the Benedicite, Sara wandered
across one of the bridges that span the river and
found herself in Battersea Park. And the lilacs
were a mass of purple flowers, and the laburnums
hanging in showers of golden rain, and the tulips
were flaunting their gaudy colours, and the birds
singing full-throated songs of joy.</p>

<p>She sat down on a bench near a great bed of
golden tulips and looked at them. And the colour
took her back to Italy, and the courtyard of Casa
di Corleone and the golden oranges, and she knew
now the truth of Christopher&rsquo;s statement that
one day she would be ready to forget them. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>a little prayer rose up in her heart, a prayer that
perhaps hundreds of women were praying at that
moment before flower-decked altars, but which
Sara addressed to the bed of golden tulips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Madonna Santa,&rdquo; she prayed, in the language
she had learned to love, &ldquo;let him tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she looked up and saw Paul coming
towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew I should find you here,&rdquo; he said
quietly, and he sat down beside her.</p>

<p>And the tulips became a mass of blurred gold,
and the Music of the Heart rang so loudly in her
ears that for the moment the song of the birds
was drowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have waited a long time,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but
I cannot wait any longer. I love you, Sara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned towards him, and there was an
adorable little sob of happiness in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Paul, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you
tell me long ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Paul put both his arms round her, and
knew that his loneliness was ended.</p>

<p>There are some hours which pass like moments,
so swiftly are they borne on the wings of joy.
And in those hours Paul and Sara told each other
a hundred little things they had quite possibly
said many times before, but which had suddenly
taken on a new meaning and a great tenderness.
But for the most part they were silent, listening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>to the Music of the Heart, which was playing now
in the completest harmony.</p>

<p>At last, however, they grew alive to the fact that
the morning was very far advanced, and that they
were both hungry. For, with joy be it said, both
Paul and Sara were most delightfully human.</p>

<p>As she got up from the bench Sara looked at the
bed of tulips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want one of those,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Regardless of the little square board which
forbade the foot of man to desecrate the grass with
his tread, Paul went across to the flower-bed. He
returned with a great golden tulip on a long pale
green stem. He gave it to her. She looked down
into the shining petal-chalice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall always love yellow tulips now,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Together they set off homewards, the Duchessa
carrying the flower like a queen carrying a golden-headed
sceptre.</p>

<p>And verily she was a queen, for she had that
morning entered her kingdom&mdash;the kingdom of a
man&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course, she went back to lunch with him at
the studio, and equally, of course, there happened
to be no food but bread and cheese and tomatoes.
She refused to be taken to a restaurant, and
Paul&rsquo;s man was sent out to buy spaghetti, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>which and the tomatoes and cheese Sara made a
true Italian dish, cooking it on a gas stove.</p>

<p>And it was when they had eaten that and were
drinking their coffee, in the making of which Paul
excelled, that Sara suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I shall know what is in the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she had to tell Paul about the late
Duca&rsquo;s will and the letter. Paul listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dearest,&rdquo; he said, when she had ended,
&ldquo;do you realize what you are giving up? I am a
poor man, and you will lose everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sara replied in the words of Christopher:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Paul, dear, I gain everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Paul took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>After that they talked about the future. No
one was to be told of their happiness yet, except
Christopher and Paul&rsquo;s mother. They would keep
it a secret known only to those four. In June Sara
was going to Italy, when she would take her portrait
and leave it in the gallery. In July she would
return for Paul to claim her completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at least I shall know,&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;that
my portrait is in the gallery, and that I love the
place ten thousand times more than those haughty
ladies who will now, I suppose, look upon it as
entirely their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And loving it like that you give it up?&rdquo; said
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you,&rdquo; answered the Duchessa softly.</p>

<span class="ph3">BARNABAS SCHEMES WITH CUPID</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND while the Music of the Heart was
making incessant melody for Paul and the
Duchessa, the Small Boy with drooping wings was
still sitting disconsolate in the corner of Aurora&rsquo;s
studio. His arrows being useless he had tried
whispering secrets to her, but delightful whispers of
flower-scented nights, country lanes aglow with
wild roses, kisses, and even cuddling babies fell on
deaf ears. She heard nothing but the call of the
false goddess whom she had erected in the place
of the glorious goddess who sits so near to Nature.</p>

<p>One day early in June Aurora was in a particularly
dissatisfied mood. The model, Tilly, who
posed not only for Barnabas, but for many
other studios, had been distinctly rude that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Aurora had found inspiration lacking, and had
told Tilly she could go. It had been the signal
for a tirade on Tilly&rsquo;s part. She had spoken her
mind freely, with contemptuous words regarding
artists who achieved nothing, and whose pictures,
even when completed, were so incomprehensible
that they could find no place in any gallery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>Aurora had told Tilly not to come near her studio
again. But her words had held a sting which hurt.
Aurora was near tears.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that Alan was coming to
tea that afternoon and bringing Barnabas with
him. She dried her tears on her painting-apron
and put the kettle on the hob.</p>

<p>And perhaps it was the suspicion of tears that
Barnabas saw when he and Alan arrived, or perhaps
it was an imploring whisper from the discordant
Boy, or perhaps it was merely the sunshine and his
own exuberant spirits, but, at any rate, he had,
what the Boy considered, a heaven-born inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said suddenly, addressing himself
to the square patch of blue seen through skylight,
&ldquo;that studios are distinctly stuffy this weather.
Let&rsquo;s all go and paint out of doors a bit&mdash;be
vagabond artists.&rdquo; The thought of Kostolitz came
into his mind with the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Permanently?&rdquo; asked Alan, &ldquo;or by the
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for about three weeks or so,&rdquo; said
Barnabas. &ldquo;You, Aurora, Dan, and me. I&rsquo;ll
make Dan come too. I&rsquo;ll hire a coster cart and
donkey to carry our painting materials, a few
provisions, and a small tent for Aurora to sleep
in. We three can sleep in the open. Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
ended Barnabas slyly, &ldquo;study Art in Nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The symbolism of Nature,&rdquo; murmured Alan
dreamily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Nature without the symbolism,&rdquo; said
Aurora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of symbolism.&rdquo; Her voice
was almost petulant.</p>

<p>The Small Boy in the corner perked up.
Barnabas grinned gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is Tuesday. Let us
start on Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aurora firmly, &ldquo;I want to get
away from everything.&rdquo; Her eyes took in the
studio and her own High Art productions in a
comprehensive sweep. &ldquo;For a time,&rdquo; she added,
seeing that Alan was looking reproachful.</p>

<p>Barnabas promulgated a few further ideas on
the subject, and they all three studied a large
cycling map of Aurora&rsquo;s which had small country
lanes plainly marked on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring the map,&rdquo; said Barnabas, as he rose to
take his leave. &ldquo;And Thursday, remember, at
my studio, at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went round to see Miss Mason that evening to
tell her of the plan. Pippa, in a purple dressing-gown,
listened entranced. She had been given a
quarter of an hour&rsquo;s grace from bed on account of
Barnabas&rsquo; arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; ended Barnabas, &ldquo;on Thursday at ten
o&rsquo;clock we start off to study Nature. I&rsquo;ve already
hired a donkey and cart. To-morrow I buy a tent
and a few other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa gave a huge sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just you, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>Monsieur Dan, and Monsieur Alan, and Mademoiselle
Aurora. Just you four. I s&rsquo;pose ze tent
will be quite tiny. Only just big enough for
Mademoiselle Aurora. Not a teeny bit more room
in it. Not even enough room for Mimsi&rdquo;&mdash;Mimsi
was the grey kitten&mdash;&ldquo;and most certainly
not enough room for&mdash;for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas laughed. He looked at Miss Mason.
The idea conveyed by Pippa in this flagrant hint
had occurred to him.</p>

<p>Pippa heard something in the laugh that made
her heart beat hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she said reflectively, &ldquo;not very big.
Or,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;a cart would be a <i>very</i> nice
ting to sleep in. I wonder what it feels like to
sleep in a cart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time you went to bed,&rdquo; said Miss Mason
grimly.</p>

<p>Pippa got up reluctantly. &ldquo;Bon soir, Monsieur
Barnabas,&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh. &ldquo;I wonder
if Mademoiselle Aurora can darn holes in men&rsquo;s
socks. Madame Barbin taught me to darn&mdash;oh,
but to darn very beautifully. Much walking will
no doubt make many holes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas telegraphed a question to Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d get tired walking,&rdquo; said Miss Mason
gruffly.</p>

<p>Pippa looked dubious. &ldquo;I am not ver&rsquo; &rsquo;eavy.
I could perhaps ride in ze cart just sometimes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>Besides,&rdquo; she ended hopefully, &ldquo;it is ver&rsquo; good to
be tired. One sleep well at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go to bed and sleep well now,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason.</p>

<p>Pippa sighed again heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Aunt Oleeve, good night, Monsieur
Barnabas.&rdquo; She went away sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she might come?&rdquo; said Barnabas.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take great care of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tire her out, and she&rsquo;ll be a trouble to
you,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. She was hating the
thought of parting with the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;The question is,
will you spare her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a genius for hitting the truth full on the
head, Barnabas. I suppose I must. She&rsquo;d adore
it, and the open air life would be excellent for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. And the tour in the
donkey-cart was to be fraught with a curious little
incident which was to lead infinitely further than
anyone could imagine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thursday dawned bright and sunny under a
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>The donkey-cart was outside Barnabas&rsquo; studio,
and Pippa in a green dress and rough straw hat
trimmed with daisies was feeding the animal with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>sugar. She had instantly christened him Pegasus,
for though he was not a winged horse he was most
unquestionably a magic steed.</p>

<p>Painting materials, a hamper of provisions, and
the tent were packed into the cart. Pippa climbed
in. Seated on the luggage she held the reins.
Barnabas took hold of the bridle.</p>

<p>The men were in tweed knickerbocker suits and
soft felt hats. Aurora was in a blue serge skirt,
a white blouse, scarlet tie, and a blue sun-bonnet.
She felt that the attire was suited to the part of a
vagabond.</p>

<p>The other three artists of the courtyard were
there watching them and offering advice. Paul,
in his own happiness, felt in entire sympathy with
their gaiety. Jasper and Michael felt somehow
rather out of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have had the cart meet you
somewhere,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
mobbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Barnabas cheerfully.
&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s size is protection enough for the lot of
us. Good-bye, Aunt Olive. Ta-ta, you fellows.
We&rsquo;re off to study Nature. We&rsquo;ll write our comments
to you and post the letters at country post
offices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa flicked the whip and Pegasus walked
gravely out of the courtyard. And the little faun
in the garden played a gay tune on his pipe. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>youthful spirits of the departing cavalcade appealed
to him.</p>

<p>And Miss Mason went back to her studio, and
for the first time since a year ago she felt a little
lonely, for both Barnabas and Pippa had gone, and
the Duchessa di Corleone was on her way to Italy
with the portrait.</p>

<p>But the Fates had another thread in readiness,
and she was not to feel lonely long.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="ph3">THE INTERFERENCE OF A FAIRY GODMOTHER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>IPPA had been wont to haunt Jasper&rsquo;s studio
a good deal. His pictured saints appealed to
her imagination. She loved the brilliance of their
robes and the gold of their backgrounds.</p>

<p>Colour appealed to her, as already seen,
enormously, though she had no power with brush
or pencil herself. If she was ever to find expression
for the thoughts and fancies which filled her
brain she would possibly one day find it in writing.
Beauty of language already moved her profoundly,
and she would listen by the hour to anyone reading
poetry aloud.</p>

<p>Jasper missed the child almost more than Miss
Mason did. He seemed to have nothing to fill up
the gap she left in his life, and his old restlessness
in a measure returned. He took to dropping in
at Miss Mason&rsquo;s studio at odd hours, in order,
so it seemed, to talk about Pippa, though he would
often sit moody and silent. He would stare at the
picture of Pippa wrapped in scarlet silk, her arms
round the faun&rsquo;s neck, which picture Barnabas had
painted about a month previously, and which now
hung in Miss Mason&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>And one evening after looking at it for a long
time he made a sudden remark&mdash;a remark that
seemed forced from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Stella had lived she would have been nearly
the same age as Pippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;was Stella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little girl,&rdquo; said Jasper shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. And then she added
quietly, &ldquo;and your wife died too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jasper, &ldquo;she is alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. The studio window was
wide open, and the evening sunlight was streaming
in. From one of the trees in the garden a
thrush was singing a song of love and happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Miss Mason suddenly, &ldquo;you
would care to tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jasper told her. He told her the whole
story, omitting nothing; though, wonderful to
relate, making no excuses for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;that Bridget lost all
interest in life, and I was always wanting her to
be something she had lost the power of being. And
I got disheartened because she could not adapt
herself to my pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Mason did not reply. She
did not care to say that it had been largely Jasper&rsquo;s
fault that his wife had lost interest in life. After
a moment she spoke slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is always dangerous to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>try and cut people to our own pattern. We are
so terribly apt to cut the cords of love first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Jasper, &ldquo;and now it is, as she
said, too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is never too late,&rdquo; said Miss Mason energetically.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave her my word of honour that I would
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;It is sometimes
infinitely more honourable to break one&rsquo;s word
than to keep it. This is a case in point. Do you
still care for your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper hesitated. &ldquo;I care for my memory of
her as she was when I first married her&mdash;before
the child died. I know after that at first I was
disgusted. But that passed, especially later when
I saw less of her. Then at the bottom of my
heart I wanted to get back to the old footing.
Somehow it seemed impossible. Before I saw her
I felt I loved her, but the sight of her untidiness
and the sordidness of the surroundings killed it.
It would be killed again if I saw her now. It&rsquo;s no
use pretending otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take her out of her surroundings
then?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>Jasper looked up quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I love her now, but if I went down there
the feeling would die away. When I see her
slovenly and untidy it seems to kill my affection.
I can&rsquo;t help it. Even when I was a child I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>not eat the food I most liked if it were served in a
careless fashion. I have honestly tried to fight
the feeling. It is, however, part of my physical
nature, and I can&rsquo;t rid myself of it.&rdquo; Jasper&rsquo;s voice
was quite humble and genuine.</p>

<p>Miss Mason&rsquo;s brain was working rapidly. &ldquo;I
suppose Chiswick is rather a commonplace
neighbourhood,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Foolish of you
to choose it in the first instance. Where did you
say the house was?&rdquo; The question was put
indifferently.</p>

<p>Jasper mentioned the street and number. Miss
Mason appeared hardly to have heard it. She
seemed engrossed in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Jasper stayed a little longer in the studio. It
was, in a sense, a comfort to have spoken of the
story, and yet it had brought the memory of the
last seven years almost too vividly before his
mind.</p>

<p>When he got up to go Miss Mason held out her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel too
miserable. Things often turn out better than one
expects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when he had gone she sat a long time in
her big chair, her brain full of the wildest and
most exciting plans, in which she was establishing
herself as proxy to the Fates. And the Fates
laughed, and gave the threads of two lives
temporarily into her hands for her own weaving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>The next morning Miss Mason told Sally to
order a taxi to be at the studio at eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not taken there quickly,&rdquo; she said to
herself, &ldquo;my courage will fail me, and I shall come
home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she went over in her mind many sentences
she had been carefully preparing during the long
hours of a sleepless night.</p>

<p>One of them began rather like an old-fashioned
letter. &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Merton, I have ventured
to call upon you in order to discuss a matter I
am sure you must have very much at heart,
namely, the welfare of your husband Jasper
Merton.&rdquo; She had repeated it a good many times
to make sure she had it verbatim.</p>

<p>There were other phrases such as, &ldquo;Pardon
what may appear an unwarrantable interference
on my part.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;The mutual interest we both
must feel in one for whom you have a wifely love,
and I the affection of friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt she had them all glibly on her tongue,
when the hoot of the taxi outside the studio warned
her of its arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am not back to lunch, Sally,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason, with the air of one embarking on some
dangerous enterprise from which she might never
return, &ldquo;run out and buy a chop for yourself, and
we can have the steak this evening. And give
Mimsi a piece of boiled whiting and a saucerful
of milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>She got into the taxi, tightly clutching her
black satin bag, and sat down in one corner. It
was the first time she had driven in a taxi, and
she felt a trifle nervous. But for her desire to
arrive at her destination before she had time to
change her mind about going, she would undoubtedly
have taken a four-wheeler.</p>

<p>The speed of the vehicle seemed excessive, but
as other taxis passed them going at an even greater
rate, she made up her mind to hope for the best.
She did, however, put up a small mental prayer
for safety.</p>

<p>In spite of the rate at which they were travelling
they seemed a long time in getting to their
destination. At last Miss Mason began to feel
uneasy. She had heard of people being kidnapped
and murdered on account of their money, and
though she had only put ten shillings worth of
silver and one sovereign in her purse, the chauffeur
might think her worth infinitely more.</p>

<p>She decided to ask him how much further they
had to go. She noticed a long tube hanging from
the front window. It was no doubt a whistle.
She took it up and blew gently down it. There
was no sound. She collected the whole force of
her lungs and blew violently. The chauffeur,
feeling a sudden and unpleasant draught at the
back of his neck, looked round. He saw Miss
Mason purple in the face from her efforts, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>the speaking tube at her lips. Fearing apoplexy
he stopped the taxi and came to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot is it, mum?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wanted to know if we were near the
address I gave you?&rdquo; she said breathlessly.
&ldquo;I think this whistle must be out of order, I can&rsquo;t
make it sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chauffeur grunted. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no bloomin&rsquo;
whistle-pipe. That there&rsquo;s a speakin&rsquo; toob,&rdquo; he
remarked scornfully. &ldquo;Be at Oxford Road in
five minutes now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shut the door with a bang and climbed back
to his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whistle!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Whistle!
Thought there was a bloomin&rsquo; draught. The old
party must &rsquo;ave fair busted &rsquo;erself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason sank back in her corner and began
to repeat the sentences in a rapid whisper.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the taxi stopped before
a small house divided from the pavement by a
gravel plot.</p>

<p>The chauffeur got down and opened the taxi
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere y&rsquo;are, mum,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Miss Mason got out, paid the man, crossed the
gravel plot, and mounted the steps. Her heart was
beating uncomfortably fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Merton at home?&rdquo; she asked of
Emma, who opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m. Will you come inside&rsquo;m?&rdquo; She
showed Miss Mason into the dismal little parlour.
&ldquo;What name shall I say, &rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Merton won&rsquo;t know my name,&rdquo; said
Miss Mason desperately. &ldquo;But ask her if she will
speak to me for a few moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emma left the room breathing heavily as she
moved, and Miss Mason sat very upright on the
little sofa, her hands still clutching the black
satin bag. Her eyes took in the whole room.
She saw the dingy and torn tablecloth, the rather
dirty chintz covers to the chairs, and the distinctly
dirty muslin curtains to the windows.
A mantel-border which covered the chimney-piece
had come unnailed at one side, and was
hanging in an untidy festoon. The carpet was
faded, and crumbs scattered from the last meal
were below one of the chairs. There was a large
Japanese fan in the fender before the empty
grate; its edges were broken and torn. It was
also considerably fly-marked. Miss Mason could
understand Jasper&rsquo;s feelings very well. She saw
what the place must mean to a man of his
fastidious instincts. It might be that he was
largely to blame that it had ever reached such a
state, but having reached it it was almost unavoidable
that he should shrink from it.</p>

<p>A step on the stairs made her start. She
clutched more tightly at the bag and began
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>murmuring &ldquo;unwarrantable intrusion,&rdquo; &ldquo;mutual
interest,&rdquo; in a spasmodic fashion, her eyes fixed on
the door.</p>

<p>Suddenly it opened, and a woman in a rather
soiled white dress came into the room. She made
Miss Mason think of a faded lily.</p>

<p>The woman looked with something like amazement
at the odd figure in the mushroom hat, grey
dress, and wide white linen collar, seated on the
sofa clutching a black satin bag.</p>

<p>Miss Mason got to her feet. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she
began, but the rest of the sentence was lost. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
downright nervous,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, with one
of her gruff little laughs, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll think me an
interfering old fool, but I was bound to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget looked at her. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said
with a note of anxiety in her voice, &ldquo;anything
wrong with Jasper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Miss Mason quickly, &ldquo;but I was
talking to him last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bridget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Miss Mason, and stopped. It
seemed entirely impossible now to put her ideas
into words. It is one thing to have marvellous
and fairy tale schemes in one&rsquo;s mind, and plan all
kinds of wonderful arrangements during the magic
hours of the night. It is quite another to find
words for them in broad daylight and in a rather
sordid little parlour, especially when they seemed
to resolve themselves into the rather impertinent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>statement that Jasper would love his wife if she
brushed her hair. It is hardly a suggestion one
can make in cold blood to a complete stranger. &ldquo;I
just came,&rdquo; ended Miss Mason helplessly.</p>

<p>She looked through the window wondering how
she could best make her escape, and wishing with
all her heart that she had kept the taxi.</p>

<p>It was Bridget herself who came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;that Jasper told
you our story&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sordid little story, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;and
you wanted to help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason nodded. Something in Bridget&rsquo;s
eyes made her own fill with tears. She forgot her
desire to run away. She felt that she was near a
dumb animal in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Bridget, &ldquo;what Jasper told
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very stumblingly Miss Mason gave her some
idea of the conversation. She wanted her to
know the truth, yet dreaded to hurt her more than
necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Jasper does care a little,&rdquo; said Bridget
wonderingly. &ldquo;But all this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She looked
round the dingy room. &ldquo;What was your idea
when you came to me?&rdquo; she asked simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great interference on my part, no doubt,&rdquo;
said Miss Mason gruffly. &ldquo;Began to make up a
plan. Thought if he was to see you again in a
pretty room and a pretty frock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped.</p>

<p>Bridget glanced down at her own dress.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said again. She had reddened
slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can tell me to go if you like,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason. &ldquo;Had no business to come. But thought&mdash;&mdash; My
dear. I just planned to take you to a
pretty room and bring Jasper to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget looked at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you
are,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;nor anything about
you. But you are a dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not angry?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; said Bridget, in a muffled voice, &ldquo;to
cry. But I&rsquo;m not going to. What were your
plans? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d made some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Miss Mason unfolded all the schemes
she had planned during the night hours. They
were of a little flat somewhere in Chelsea not too
far from the studios. The drawing-room was to
be furnished in shades of brown and cream, and
it was to be filled with roses in slender glass vases
and china bowls. And there was to be a woman
among the flowers, and Jasper coming in to find
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t the money for that,&rdquo; said
Bridget. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t ask Jasper for any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have,&rdquo; said Miss Mason bluntly. &ldquo;My
dear, I&rsquo;m an old woman. Is it worth while to you,
for your husband&rsquo;s sake, to give me the pleasure of
arranging it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget bit her lip. She tried to speak, but no
words would come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to say anything,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Bridget. And, somehow,
the next moment she was down on her knees by
Miss Mason, who was soothing her with little odd
articulations and pattings as she had soothed Pippa
one night when she had awakened from a bad
dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Bridget at last, sitting up and
pushing back her hair from her face, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all
been so lonely. At times I&rsquo;ve felt that just for
something to do I could be bad&mdash;really bad, you
know. Anything for excitement, and to forget my
own thoughts. At first I used to hate myself.
Then I tried to hate Jasper, but I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t.
I&mdash;I loved him all the time. You see, he gave me
my baby. But I was so lonely and miserable I
wanted to be wicked, only I remembered my baby,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been lonely?&rdquo; asked Bridget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Utterly lonely, my dear, for fifty-five years
at least, ever since my parents died. And only
women can understand the loneliness of women.
Men have their pipes, and they can always swear
a little, which must at times be an enormous help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not lonely now?&rdquo; asked Bridget.</p>

<p>Miss Mason smiled, a little glad smile. &ldquo;My
dear, I am so utterly happy now that I long for
every one else to be happy. It was that that made
me so sorry for you and Jasper, and made me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>want to come and see you. And now I want you
to come and have some luncheon with me somewhere&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
have to tell me where&mdash;and then
we&rsquo;ll go and look at flats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget got up from the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all too wonderful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve the right to let you help
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Mason gruffly. &ldquo;Might
just as well say I&rsquo;ve no right to ask you to give
me the pleasure of doing a little thing like this;
but I&rsquo;m going to ask you, all the same. Now go
and put on a hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget left the room. In a few moments she
came down in a dark blue linen coat and skirt, and
a black straw hat swathed with rose-coloured silk.
She had brushed her hair and looked a different
being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we get a four-wheeler?&rdquo; asked Miss
Mason. &ldquo;Came in a taxi, but didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a train and an omnibus,&rdquo; said Bridget,
&ldquo;that will take us to Notting Hill Gate, and we
can get any amount of cabs from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So for the first time in her life Miss Mason
mounted to the top of an omnibus and thoroughly
enjoyed it. She peered over garden walls as they
passed, and did her best to look through windows,
and made up a good many quite fascinating stories
about the inhabitants of the houses&mdash;stories very
different from the mental pictures of the very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>same lives that Jasper had been wont to paint.
In Miss Mason&rsquo;s stories there was always a
mother&mdash;a mother clasping the downy head of a
new-born baby to her heart; a mother watching
the first toddling steps of a tiny child; a mother
hearing a little white-nightgowned figure lisp a
childish prayer. The father in these stories&mdash;of
course there was a father&mdash;took an extraordinarily
back seat.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a
question from Bridget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did Jasper come to tell you our story?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were looking at a picture of Pippa,&rdquo;
replied Miss Mason quietly, &ldquo;and he said that
little Stella would have been nearly the same age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridget nodded. For a moment she was silent.
Then she spoke again. &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is
Pippa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little girl,&rdquo; said Miss Mason promptly.
&ldquo;At least, she came to me out of the Nowhere last
December, and now she&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Christmas gift,&rdquo; said Bridget.</p>

<p>Miss Mason nodded. &ldquo;I like to hear you say
that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I gave Pippa her first Christmas
tree. It was my first for the matter of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then they fell to talking about Pippa and
Stella, after the fashion of women who love
children, each capping the other with a new
anecdote. But after a time Miss Mason was left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>to do most of the talking, for Bridget suddenly
found her voice fail her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pippa,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;has true inventive
genius. One night last January I told her to say
her prayers before she got into bed. She announced
that she&rsquo;d already said them. &lsquo;Where?&rsquo;
I asked. &lsquo;In my baf,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;much warmer.&rsquo;
I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling there was a good deal to be
said in favour of the bathroom on a cold winter&rsquo;s
night. But all the same, I told her she was
irreverent to say her prayers lying down. I knew
she&rsquo;d said them that way. She always ends her
ablutions with lying full length in the water.
Whereupon she remarked in an aggrieved voice,
&lsquo;Turned over on my front, anyhow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True prostration in prayer,&rdquo; laughed Bridget.
&ldquo;I shall love Pippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already it was almost impossible to believe
Bridget to be the same apathetic woman who,
slovenly and untidy, had entered the dingy little
parlour barely two hours previously. After lunch
and on the way to some flats in Beaufort Street
she was almost radiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will put things through as quickly as we
can,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;I hate loitering when
one has set out on a piece of business.&rdquo; And in
her heart she was longing to get Bridget away
from the dismal surroundings of her present
home without a moment&rsquo;s delay. She would have
liked to take her to her own studio, only there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>no second bedroom, and also Jasper would have
seen her.</p>

<p>After a little search Miss Mason decided on a
flat she thought would do. It was on the third
floor, and consisted of a dining-room, a drawing-room,
four bedrooms, a servant&rsquo;s room, a bathroom,
and kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you to say as you&rsquo;ll be living in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s heavenly,&rdquo; said Bridget ecstatically, &ldquo;but
really there are an unnecessary number of rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Miss Mason firmly. &ldquo;I hope
you&rsquo;ll be here a long time, and&mdash;one never
knows,&rdquo; she ended significantly. Which little
speech caused Bridget to blush crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rent,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;is my affair for
the first year, at all events, till you&rsquo;ve got rid of
the house in Chiswick. And the furniture will
be my wedding present, as I didn&rsquo;t happen to
know you when the ceremony took place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bridget, her eyes full of happy tears, put
her arms round Miss Mason and kissed her.</p>

<span class="ph3">THE HEART OF NATURE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>URING the next three weeks the two conspirators
were wildly busy. Money is a key
which smooths many difficulties, and the path
before them was triumphantly easy.</p>

<p>Jasper found Miss Mason a little hard to understand
during these days. She had a way of
looking at him and then giving vent to odd little
chuckles of laughter. He hoped she was not
becoming childish.</p>

<p>She received several letters from the donkey
tourists. One, received about the tenth day, told
her that another of her schemes was on the way to
be started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; wrote Barnabas, &ldquo;enjoying ourselves
immensely. The weather is glorious, and
Pegasus a model of well-behaved donkeyness.
He certainly deserves wings, even though he
hasn&rsquo;t got them. But I heard Pippa telling him
in a consoling voice the other day that when he
reached heaven he&rsquo;d be provided with a pair of
beautiful white ones. I fancy she sees in herself
a female Bellerophon soaring aloft and through
golden streets on a grey donkey. If the golden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>streets are anything like as beautiful as the
country lanes through which we are driving we
shall be happy. I wish you could see them&mdash;the
lanes, I mean. They are a bower of fairy delight.
Wild roses, honeysuckle, and meadow-sweet
seem to vie with each other in filling the warm
air with perfume. Larks&mdash;I never knew before
that the world held so many&mdash;sing to us from
heaven, the sweetest feathered choristers. Last
night a nightingale sang to us in the light of a full
moon. It was the first Pippa had heard. There
was something almost terrifying in her rapture.
She feels almost too keenly. She is, however,
absolutely in her element, and if I had ever felt
any real doubt about her being the child of
Kostolitz I should only have needed to see her
out here to convince me. At times she finds the
most adorable bits of language in which to
express her emotions. But then it is always
some little thing like the colour of a flower-chalice
or the glint of the kingfisher&rsquo;s blue. We saw one
the other day. It skimmed up a bit of transparent
water and perched on a piece of stick in midstream.
Pippa and I watched it, holding our
breath. All at once something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what&mdash;startled it. There was a streak of iridescent
colour and it had gone. But it left us
both with the joyous feeling of discovery. The
bird is too rare and too beautiful to leave one
entirely unmoved. Pippa could talk of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>incident. It is the bigger aspects of Nature that
hold her dumb. We came to a wood one evening&mdash;pines,
straight and solemn as the aisles of a
cathedral, the setting sun slanting down the
long spaces. Pippa&rsquo;s face was a marvel. She
just put her hand up to her throat and held it
there as if it ached with the beauty of the thing,
and then she made the sign of the Cross. It was
holy ground, though there had been no priestly
ceremonial to proclaim it so. Only the wind was
there to whisper a benediction, and the trees
themselves were like priests scattering the incense
of their fragrant breath. The very memory of it
brings thoughts of poetry to my mind. But again
to Pippa. She&rsquo;s yours, and I want you to know
her as I&rsquo;m seeing her now, for it&rsquo;s the essence of
her&mdash;the spirit of Kostolitz I&rsquo;m seeing. A long
line of cawing rooks, whether at sunset or against
the blue sky, affects her strangely. It seems to
make her unutterably sad. Temporarily only,
I am glad to say, for she is the gayest of children,
and delights in the smallest of pleasures&mdash;namely,
a pennyworth of bull&rsquo;s-eyes and sticks of pink-and-white
striped stuff which we buy from
extremely minute shops, whose windows are
crammed below with apples&mdash;foreign, of course&mdash;and
nuts. Above the apples and nuts are rows
of glass bottles full of pear-drops, lemon-drops,
peppermints, and barley-sugar, also sugar candy
the real article, rough and scrunchly on a string.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>And somewhere in the window, very inconspicuous,
is a slit through which one can drop
letters&mdash;the sweetstuff shop is always the post
office. But sweets evidently take decided precedence
over such minor considerations as letters
and postage stamps. There is always a garden
leading up to the shop, and it is always crammed
with flowers, the stiff old-fashioned kind&mdash;sweet-williams,
stocks, marigolds, mignonette, asters,
and such-like. There are bushes, too, of lavender,
and lad&rsquo;s-love. I painted one of them, but somehow
did not hit it off. I&rsquo;ve made another sketch,
though, of a pond, a willow, meadow-sweet, and
blue hills, which pleases me quite a lot. In fact,
I was so absorbed in it that I lost Pippa. You
needn&rsquo;t be anxious, because she is found again,
and with her something you wanted, namely,
the first candidate for your School of a Wonderful
Chance. I had just finished my sketch, and
having come back to the practicalities of life
realized that Pippa had been absent for two hours.
When lo! and behold she appeared, and with her a
loose-limbed fellow of about twenty. When he
fills out he will rival Dan in size&mdash;but that is
beside the mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Barnabas,&rsquo; she cried&mdash;ceremony and with
it the Monsieur has lapsed into disuse in the open
air&mdash;&lsquo;do look at ze lovely little figure &rsquo;e &rsquo;as made.
&lsquo;Is name is Andrew McAndrew.&rsquo; And she rolled
her r&rsquo;s with gusto. Well, it is pleasant to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>that Pippa should be the one to find your first
candidate, and it is curious to think it is one who,
if I am not much mistaken, will one day be a great
sculptor. The little figure of a young girl, made
from the clay of the river, was to my mind simply
a marvel. I learnt his story. I&rsquo;ll not give it in
the broad Scotch in which he told it, for it would
take you your whole time to make it out. He
lived in London&mdash;Bayswater way&mdash;with a
widowed mother, whom he supports by typing
in a stuffy little office which he loathes, though
he has not been without hope that &lsquo;Aiblins the
gud Lorrd would find a way out for him one o&rsquo;
these days.&rsquo; Whenever he has any spare time
he models in clay, which mercifully is an inexpensive
material. He has at the moment a
week&rsquo;s holiday, during which he is tramping the
country, sleeping under a hedge or at the foot of
a hayrick, eating bread and cheese like any tramp,
and enjoying himself finely&mdash;as we are. Pippa,
it appears, watched him at work, herself hidden,
like the fairy she is, in a mass of meadow-sweet.
Suddenly she appeared from among it, and they
entered into a conversation which must have been
curious, conducted in a broad Scotch on his side,
and in broken English on hers&mdash;though her
English is progressing rapidly. Anyhow, she
made him understand she was out with a party
of artists. He was all agog to meet us, and she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>brought him along. He will join us for the next
three days, instead of making his way again in
the direction of London as he had intended, and
we&rsquo;ve arranged between us to send him back by
train. As soon as I&rsquo;m at my studio again he will
look me up, and I&rsquo;ll bring him along to see you.
I&rsquo;ve given him no inkling of the Wonderful
Chance before him. That is for you to do. But
he&rsquo;s one of the right ones for it and no mistake.
You won&rsquo;t mind if we keep on the tour till the
end of June, will you? Cupid is sitting gaily in
the donkey-cart alongside Pippa, and though
Aurora and Alan don&rsquo;t quite realize his presence
yet, they soon will discover him, and will no
doubt bring him back as a permanent guest to
London. That, of course, was my main idea
when I proposed the tour. High Art, thank
goodness, is getting wan and pale. She had
almost her death-blow the other day when Aurora
made a daisy-chain with which she adorned
Alan, and he fell into a pond dabbling after
tadpoles for Pippa. We fished him out and
wrapped him in a rug, while we spread his
clothes in a buttercup field to dry. The warmth
of their gold was enough to dry them, let alone
the sun. I heard Cupid chuckling, the rogue!
We miss you a lot, and the best thing we
have to look forward to on our return is your
welcome....&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Miss Mason put down the letter with a little
sigh of happiness. Her heart felt nearly as warm
and sunny as the buttercup field.</p>

<p>Then she set out to meet Bridget at Storey&rsquo;s
in Kensington High Street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Exactly three weeks after Miss Mason&rsquo;s peregrination
to Chiswick she put a request to Jasper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; she said, in as careless a voice as she
could assume, &ldquo;to call on a friend of mine this
afternoon, and I want you to come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasper looked dismayed. &ldquo;I should be
delighted,&rdquo; he said mendaciously, &ldquo;only calling
isn&rsquo;t a bit in my line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite near at hand,&rdquo; said Miss Mason;
&ldquo;only at a flat in Beaufort Street, and I particularly
want you to meet my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Jasper, suppressing a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;at half-past
three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the hour appointed Jasper appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better call a taxi,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
She felt it impossible to walk. She would have
run all the way, a proceeding which would have
undoubtedly have astonished Jasper.</p>

<p>As the taxi drew up at the door of a block of
flats in Beaufort Street, a woman looked for a
moment from a window. As she saw the two
figures get out she drew back into the room. Her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>heart was beating so loudly she could almost hear it.</p>

<p>Miss Mason rang the bell of the flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mistress at home?&rdquo; she said to the dapper
little maid who opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m. What name &rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason and Mr. Merton,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason firmly.</p>

<p>They went into the bright little passage, and
the maid threw open the door of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason and Mr. Merton,&rdquo; she announced.</p>

<p>A woman in a pale green dress came forward to
meet them.</p>

<p>Jasper stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jasper,&rdquo; she said, with a little shaky laugh, and
she held out both her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bride!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and it was nearly seven
years since she had heard that name.</p>

<p>Miss Mason went quickly from the room, and
closed the door softly behind her.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before they realized her
absence. Then Bridget started up from the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Olive!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, Jasper,
isn&rsquo;t she a dear! I must go round and find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be back at her studio by now,&rdquo; said
Jasper calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d quite forgotten her,&rdquo; said Bridget contritely.
&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t we to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said Jasper. &ldquo;Come back to me
now. I want you. Aunt Olive will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE RING OF EROS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>AR away from London Pippa was swinging on
a gate. Her dress had become rather faded
from much sunshine, and her straw hat had been
baked quite brown. She had it well pulled down
to shade her eyes, so that it hid the upper part
of her face.</p>

<p>An hour ago Pippa had been crying, and for
the reason that the purple-shadowed landscape
had refused to be interpreted on canvas through
the medium of paints and brushes and her own
little brown right hand. Barnabas at her earnest
request had lent her the materials. It was not
the first time she had tried with them. He had
watched her in silence as she messed away with
the paints. Suddenly she flung the canvas face
downwards on the grass and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Kiddy?&rdquo; asked Barnabas, putting
his arm round her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all out vere,&rdquo; she said, nodding towards
the sunny landscape, &ldquo;and I can see it, and I
want to tell it to myself and ozzer peoples, like
you tell your pictures, and I can&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>She rubbed her tear-stained face up and down on
Barnabas&rsquo; coat-sleeve in an access of despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, childie,&rdquo; expostulated Barnabas, &ldquo;one
can&rsquo;t &lsquo;tell pictures,&rsquo; as you say, all in a moment.
One has to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa shook her head. &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I shall never learn. I can&rsquo;t ever tell pictures.
And it&rsquo;s all here,&rdquo; she put her hand to her heart,
&ldquo;and I want to say it so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute Barnabas was silent. Then he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there was a boy who saw
that the world was very beautiful and he wanted
to tell his own beautiful thoughts about it to
himself and to other people. One day he heard
a man playing the violin. And the man made
the violin speak so that in its music it said the
most wonderful things. It told about the moon
shining on a sleeping sea, and the secrets the
little waves whispered to the shore. It told of
silver streams whose banks were starred with
primroses, and it told of great forests where the
trees were standing dark and still in the purple
night waiting for the first rosy flush of dawn. It
told of the laughter of little children, and the
songs young mothers sing to their babies. All
these things the music of the violin told, and the
boy listened, and said to himself, &lsquo;I will play the
violin, for I know now the way I can tell my
thoughts to the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Pippa was listening entranced. &ldquo;Had he got a
violin?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;but someone gave
him a violin, and he had lessons, and he practised
for many hours, but the violin would not speak
his thoughts in the way he wished it to. And one
day the great violinist he had first heard play
came to the house. He listened to the boy playing
but he didn&rsquo;t say very much. You see, he was a
big man, and the big men never discourage the
little men. Remember that, Pippa, my child.
Well, when the boy had finished playing, the
Master just wagged his shaggy great head to and
fro and said, &lsquo;Um, um, um. The lad&rsquo;s got something
to say, but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and then he went away.
But he came again to see the boy. And that time
he didn&rsquo;t ask him to play, but he just sat talking
to him. And while he talked the boy was playing
with a piece of clay, for he was very fond of
making figures out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Andrew,&rdquo; said Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, like Andrew. Well, while the Master
talked the boy went on doing something with
the clay, and suddenly the Master saw that it
was a likeness of himself the boy had made.
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at that, boy,&rsquo; he said. The
boy, feeling very shy and crimson, pushed it over
to him. The Master stared at it for a minute, then
he thumped his hand down on the table. &lsquo;Du
lieber Gott!&rsquo; he exclaimed in a huge big voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>that made the boy tremble, &lsquo;I knew the boy had
something to say, and behold,&rsquo; he pointed at the
clay, &lsquo;here is the language in which he shall say
it. My son,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;you have the ear to
hear the language of music, and you have the
heart to understand it, but you have not the
hand to make it speak yourself. In it you understand
the thoughts of others, but in this earth
you shall tell your own. If you live you will be
a great man.&rsquo; And he held out his hand to the
boy, who took it and kissed it, because he was
so very happy. It&rsquo;s a true story,&rdquo; ended Barnabas,
&ldquo;because the boy himself told me, only he
was a man when he told the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa nodded her head up and down. &ldquo;I like
dat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One day p&rsquo;raps I find a language.
What was ze boy&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;was
Philippe Kostolitz, and he made the little faun
which you love, and which is in my garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Pippa, with a delighted sigh. Her
tears were completely forgotten. Twenty minutes
later she was swinging on the gate.</p>

<p>Barnabas was sitting in the shadow of a hedge
near her, painting a buttercup field and a copse
of birches beyond. Dan was lying flat on his back
smoking. Andrew had gone back to London.
And Aurora and Alan were off on some business
of their own. Pegasus, tethered to a long rope,
was contentedly eating thistles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Pippa watched the birds and butterflies, which
were many, and the by-passers, which were few,
as she swung. An old man passed and called
good afternoon in a cheery voice. A trap with a
hard-worked young doctor in it drove by, and
he smiled as he saw Pippa. Then there came a
cart driven by a man, and with a boy of about
fifteen sitting on the tail-board, his legs swinging.
He made a grimace at Pippa as he passed, and
Pippa&mdash;be it told with sorrow&mdash;put out her
tongue at him. There was something of the
gamin about Pippa which was never wholly
eradicated. And after the boy there passed a
young gipsy woman carrying a baby. Pippa gave
her a three-penny bit. The woman looked hard at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some of our blood in
your veins, and you have the sad eyes and the
lucky smile of those who are born to many
happenings. The Lord keep you, little lady.&rdquo;
And she passed on her way. And after she had
gone there were only the birds and butterflies for
quite a long time.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pippa heard the distant hoot of a
motor-car. Barnabas, who had finished his
painting, came to the gate and leant over it with
her. The motor hove in sight, a great crimson
Mercedes, travelling fast.</p>

<p>Pippa waved her hand as it passed. The
occupants of the car, a man and a woman, saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>the child, and the gaiety of the sunshine being in
their hearts they waved in response. The woman,
who was swathed in a purple motor veil, waved
an ungloved hand. Pippa saw the flash of
diamonds on it. Also as she waved something fell,
but the car rounded a bend in the lane and was out
of sight almost before Pippa and Barnabas realized
it.</p>

<p>Pippa scrambled over the gate. There was
something lying in the dust, which she picked up.
She came back slowly to Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what a queer, pretty ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ruby was set in it, on which was engraved a
little figure of Eros holding a circle and trident.
The stone and its setting was undoubtedly very
ancient. The ring itself probably Georgian.</p>

<p>She held it out to Barnabas. He took it from
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said slowly, and he looked from it in
the direction the car had vanished.</p>

<p>He had seen the ring before on the hand of
Philippe Kostolitz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I keep it?&rdquo; asked Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, little thief,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;The owner
will miss it and perhaps come back for it. In any
case we shall have to try and find out who she is,
and return it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he slipped the ring into his coat-pocket.</p>

<span class="ph3">AN OLD MAN IN A GARDEN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is strange how a name long unspoken and
unheard, once coming again within one&rsquo;s ken,
comes again and again before one, and in the most
unlikely and unexpected ways.</p>

<p>For over nine years Barnabas had not chanced
to hear his friend&rsquo;s name mentioned, and now
there was first Pippa and her wonderful likeness
to him, and then the incident of the ring, both
of which had served to remind him vividly and
bring the name before him. But the third incident
was to be a good deal stranger, in fact it
was to savour somewhat of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rsquo;
Entertainments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stopped for their noon halt one day in
the shade of a small coppice. A little beyond it
they could see the roof and chimneys of a house
surrounded by a high wall. Before settling down
to lunch Barnabas strolled towards it and walked
round the wall. There was no means of seeing
over, and the only entrance was through a small
green wooden door, which was shut. Ivy grew
up the wall outside, and had Barnabas felt
disposed he might have climbed up by it and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>peered over. It was, however, too hot for such
exertion. Also if there were anyone in the garden
and he were seen, his position would have been,
to say the least of it, undignified. He strolled
back to the copse and to the lunch which the others
had unpacked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where &rsquo;ave you been?&rdquo; asked Pippa.</p>

<p>Barnabas nodded in the direction of the house.
&ldquo;Down there,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s inside?&rdquo; demanded Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Barnabas, attacking the leg
of a chicken; &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa&rsquo;s eyes became far off and dreamy.
&ldquo;<i>Quel domage!</i> You couldn&rsquo;t climb, ze wall ver&rsquo;
much too &rsquo;igh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the question of the height of the
wall, but my dignity,&rdquo; returned Barnabas.
&ldquo;What would I have looked like if I&rsquo;d been
caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; smiled Pippa, her eyes dancing with
amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no desire to look funny,&rdquo; said Barnabas.
&ldquo;Toss me over that bottle of cider, like a good
child, and look out for flying corks. I do my best,
but this weather makes the stuff too fizzy for
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa tossed the bottle and retired gravely behind
Barnabas while he manipulated the cork. Then
she returned to her seat near him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wonder what&rsquo;s inside,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cider,&rdquo; said Barnabas, pouring it into a
glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the bottle, <i>mchant</i>, the wall,&rdquo; announced
Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the wall! I don&rsquo;t know; nothing, I
daresay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Ogre,&rdquo; said Aurora. She and Alan and
Dan had been too busy feeding to enter into the
conversation before.</p>

<p>Pippa elevated her chin. &ldquo;<i>Je ne suis pas une
bb, moi.</i> I know, but quite well, vere are no
Ogres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lions, then, Miss Curiosity,&rdquo; suggested Alan.</p>

<p>Pippa turned her shoulder towards him.
&ldquo;<i>Imbcile</i>, it is not a menagerie, but I have no
interest in it, <i>moi</i>. If you wish to discover you
can go and look for yourself.&rdquo; And she proceeded
to eat chicken delicately and haughtily with her
fingers, disdaining further mention of the house
within the wall.</p>

<p>After lunch they all lay down in the shade of
the trees and went to sleep, lulled by the sleepy,
liquid note of the wood-pigeons, and the humming
of bees.</p>

<p>Barnabas was the first to awaken. When he
did he discovered that Pippa was absent. He
came out of the copse and looked down the little
lane that ran between the trees on one side and
a stretch of moorland on the other. To the left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>it would come out on the main road, to the right
it led to the wall-enclosed house.</p>

<p>Seeing no sign of the child, and not caring to
coo-ee to her on account of disturbing the
sleepers, he went down towards the house,
thinking it more than likely, from her remarks
at lunch, that she had gone to investigate the place
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daughter of Eve,&rdquo; said Barnabas to himself,
as he strolled down the sunny lane, watching the
butterflies flitting over the moorland.</p>

<p>He reached the garden wall and had strolled
round two sides of it when he suddenly came to a
standstill, arrested by the sound of Pippa&rsquo;s voice
from inside the garden.</p>

<p>He paused to listen. He could hear her words
distinctly. She was narrating to some one the
story of Philippe Kostolitz which he had told her
only a couple of days previously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Pippa ended, in her clear voice, &ldquo;I
am looking for my language. What is yours?&rdquo;
There was a note of shameless coaxing in the
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; returned a deep voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, ze garden?&rdquo; came Pippa&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>Barnabas put one foot on a stout branch of
ivy, and clinging to another branch above him,
heaved himself noiselessly to the top of the
wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Then he saw Pippa. She was seated on a
garden bench, her hat in her hands, and on the
bench beside her was an old man. His beard,
long and snow-white, reached almost to his waist.
His hair, also snow-white and very thick, glistened
in the sunlight, for his head was uncovered.
His clothes, Barnabas saw, were dark and well-cut,
and his voice was peculiarly melodious and refined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my word!&rdquo; ejaculated Barnabas,
quite forgetting that he was speaking aloud.</p>

<p>The old man looked up. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, with
a quaint smile, &ldquo;so you, too, have found the ivy
route.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say Pippa climbed up
here?&rdquo; exclaimed Barnabas, absolutely forgetful
of his own rather curious position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; cried Pippa joyfully, &ldquo;and he saw
me, and asked me to come in and see ze garden.
But did you ever see such a garden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Barnabas enthusiastically,
surveying it from his post of vantage.</p>

<p>Smooth lawns with close-clipped edges, and
flower-beds a mass of colour met his eye. There
were larkspurs tall and slender, from sapphire
blue to turquoise. There were great tree lupins,
there were roses of every shade and shape imaginable.
There were crimson and blue salvias,
scarlet and white phloxes, borders of African
marigolds&mdash;a blaze of orange; and there was a
great bed of hollyhocks, among whose silken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>flowers butterflies innumerable were hovering.
In the middle of the lawn was a marble basin
full of crystal water, on whose edge white pigeons
were preening themselves, and a couple of gorgeous
peacocks spread tails of waking eyes to the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not,&rdquo; said the old man courteously,
&ldquo;follow Pippa&rsquo;s example and enter the garden by
the door? You will find it unfastened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas slithered down off the wall and came
round to the green door. He felt as if he were
suddenly walking into a fairy tale garden in
which nothing that might happen would surprise
him.</p>

<p>The old man came forward to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said courteously, &ldquo;that the child&rsquo;s
absence has not caused you anxiety. I found a
pleasure in her conversation, and forgot that time
was passing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Barnabas assured him. &ldquo;I had
only just missed her. I came to look for her, and
heard her voice. Forgive my unceremonious
appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man smiled. &ldquo;It was as delightful as
her own,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Barnabas looked
towards the house. It was Elizabethan in
structure, with walls stained to a variety of
different colours by wind, sun, rain, and time.
Roses wreathed the latticed windows, and up one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>side of the house a great wistaria climbed, covering
part of the roof and losing itself among the
chimney-stacks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come inside?&rdquo; said the old man.
&ldquo;There is something I would like the child to
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas assented. The three sleepers in the
coppice were forgotten. The fascination of the
place and the old man&rsquo;s strange and courtly
personality was upon him.</p>

<p>The old man had led the way into the house.
They went into a square hall, dark and cool.
The floor was of inlaid wood highly polished,
the walls oak and hung with pictures. They
passed through the hall, and the old man led the
way through an arched doorway and down two
steps into a room which to the mind of Barnabas
belonged most assuredly to the ancient stories
of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo; In shape it was
circular, and hung with draperies of a curious
deep blue, like the colour of the sky at night.
The floor was also polished and covered with a
few old Persian rugs. There was an oak table at
the far side of the room, three large oak chairs,
and a kind of divan covered in sapphire-blue
silk and worked with tiny crescent moons and
stars.</p>

<p>But the arresting note of the room lay in a
marble statue on a pedestal. It would be hard
to say wherein exactly the extraordinary fascination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>of it lay. But Barnabas looked at it almost
spellbound. The old man motioned to them to sit
down, and seated himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That statue,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was given me by a
friend of mine. He used to pass many months
with me at a time. He loved the quietude of
these surroundings as I love them. At the back
of the house I had a studio built for him where he
worked. When he was not working he sat in the
garden. He loved it. He used to say he loved
the flowers both in sunlight and in moonlight, or
drenched in tears of rain. He said the Spirit of
the Garden moved among them. That was the
Figure he made of Her. Look at it well,&rdquo; he
went on, with a grave earnestness. &ldquo;Is it not
wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; echoed Barnabas from his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to me,&rdquo; said the old man quietly, &ldquo;a
perfect embodiment of an inspiration. So much
is often lost. First the inspiration-flash has to
become articulate&mdash;to be shaped in the brain&mdash;before
the hand even starts to fashion it. It
loses enormously in the process. To me that is
one of the few things that has not lost. It is the
first inspiration-flash embodied in marble. It
has never been exhibited. My friend had a curious
dislike to exhibiting his work. He was a strange
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lapsed into a thoughtful silence. Pippa
was lying back in her chair, her hands tucked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>under her chin&mdash;a usual attitude of hers. She
was gazing at the statue with wide grey eyes.
Barnabas had a certain presentiment of a name
that would shortly be mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see the place where he
worked?&rdquo; asked the old man suddenly.</p>

<p>Barnabas got up from his chair. Pippa came
across to him and slid her hand into his. Her
imagination was vividly at work.</p>

<p>They left the circular room and went down a
passage. The old man took a key from his pocket
and unlocked a door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>It was a large room, well lighted. There were
plaster casts of heads on various shelves, and
several plaster plaques hanging on the walls. At
one side of the studio Barnabas saw the plaster
figure of a little faun. It was the same as the
marble faun in his garden. Pippa did not notice
it. She was gazing at a figure, enveloped in an
old sheet, which was on a stand in the middle of
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the last piece of work he started
here,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing to it. &ldquo;It has
remained just as he left it. Nothing has been
moved. I dust the place myself. No one ever
entered it but my friend and I and the workmen
he employed. They were always foreigners, and
came from a distance. But now no one enters
but I. You are the first to come into the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Barnabas, speaking in a low voice,
&ldquo;you brought us in here because of Pippa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa had wandered to the far side of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Philippe Kostolitz was also my
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old man softly. &ldquo;And
where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did you find the child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came to us,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;out of the
Nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man smiled. &ldquo;Planted there I fancy
by Philippe.&rdquo; Then their eyes met. &ldquo;So you saw
the likeness too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the reason,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;that
I liked to talk to her. She reminded me of him.
He came and went from here as he chose. It
was on one of his tramps that he wandered in.
The door in the wall is never locked. I found
him looking at the butterflies among my hollyhocks.
He was a lad of twenty at that time. It
is twenty-five years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pippa&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; went on the old man, &ldquo;is
charming. I liked to hear it. She has a way of
looking up at one when she talks that reminds me
of our friend. She told me a delightful little story
about a sculptor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;was true. And
the sculptor was Philippe Kostolitz.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I might have
guessed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again he lapsed into silence. Suddenly he
roused himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will have fruit and cake and something
to drink,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was forgetting my
manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have only just lunched,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But fruit,&rdquo; the old man insisted, &ldquo;at least
fruit. I hold the Eastern ideas of hospitality.
Those to whom I feel friendly must eat in my
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way back into the hall and signed
to them to sit down. Then he clapped his hands
three times. An Indian, brown as mahogany, in
loose trousers, white shirt, and turban, answered
the summons. He salaamed, his face as impassive
as a mask.</p>

<p>The old man said something to him in a language
neither Barnabas nor Pippa understood, though
Barnabas guessed it to be Hindustanee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has served me,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;for
fifteen years. He is faithful as a dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live here always?&rdquo; asked Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lived here,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;for
thirty years. Up till the age of forty I travelled
far. Then I came here to peace&mdash;my thoughts,
my flowers, and my books. I have a few friends
who come to see me, and they are always
welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>He mentioned three or four names. Among
them Barnabas recognized the name of a famous
statesmen and a well-known singer.</p>

<p>The Indian returned with a tray, on which was
a dish of strawberries, some wafer biscuits, a glass
of milk, and two empty tumblers, and three small
decanters, which he placed on a table.</p>

<p>The old man helped Pippa to strawberries and
gave her the glass of milk. Then from the three
decanters he mixed a drink for Barnabas and
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Barnabas as he tasted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own brewing,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>

<p>While they ate the fruit he talked to them of
his travels. Each little narrative he told was well-turned
and concise, the language he chose was
poetical.</p>

<p>All at once he got up and went into an inner
room. He came back with the most exquisite
little Russian icon. He gave it to Pippa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have it,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;in memory of
your visit here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa was covered with rosy blushes of delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais, je vous rmerce mille fois</i>,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Barnabas, isn&rsquo;t it beautiful, but, oh, very
beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; said Barnabas.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given a great deal of pleasure.&rdquo; And
then quite suddenly, and for the first time, he
remembered the three sleepers in the wood, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>doubtless had long ago awakened. He signed to
Pippa, who got up. The old man took them into
the garden. At the green door he held out his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come again and see me?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I live, as you see, alone among my flowers. Ali
looks after my bodily needs, and I have a man who
helps me in my garden. I do not, as a rule, see
people&mdash;beyond the few friends I mentioned to
you. But it would give me great pleasure if you
will come. My name is Adam Gray, and my
house is called The Close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Barnabas promised that one day they would
come again.</p>

<p>So they left the enchanted garden and went up
the lane among the butterflies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;d been dreaming,&rdquo; said Pippa
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, my dear,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve both been doing&mdash;dreaming a very
fantastic Arabian Night&rsquo;s dream, which nobody
would believe if we told it to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then from afar an extremely wakeful Dan
saw them and hailed them in wrathful accents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where on earth have you two been?&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hunting for you for the last
hour and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in a fairy tale,&rdquo; said Barnabas,
as he reached him, &ldquo;where clocks and watches
are not admitted, and where turbaned Indians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>bring red, white, and green drinks in cut-glass
decanters, which when mixed together is drink fit
for the gods. Now let me help you to harness
Pegasus. And if you&rsquo;ll leave off staring I&rsquo;ll tell
you about it, only Pippa knows you won&rsquo;t believe
it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Mason, in her studio in London, received
a registered packet from Barnabas. She opened
it, and found inside a letter and a curious signet
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are on our way home,&rdquo; wrote Barnabas.
&ldquo;Cupid has triumphed and is holding the reins
of Pegasus. Pippa, Dan, and I are taking back
seats. Kisses and moonlight&mdash;there&rsquo;s a full
moon&mdash;predominate, and I saw Aurora hugging
a rosy-cheeked baby in a cottage garden. High
Art gave one groan and expired. She has never,
never moved again. The call of wedding bells is
bringing us back to London. You may expect
us on Friday. I am enclosing a ring which was
dropped from a passing motor-car. Fortunately
I saw the number. It was a London car. I am
advertising for the owner of the ring in various
London papers, and have given your studio as
the address to which to apply, though I gave my
own name. Therefore I send you the ring. You
will, of course, take the name and address of the
claimant. Dan and I will be glad to be home
again. Though Nature in her present sunny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>mood is extraordinarily entrancing, there is a
good deal to be said in favour of spring mattresses....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked at the ring, turning it
curiously in her hand. Then she put it away in a
little carved box which she locked.</p>

<span class="ph3">ANDREW MCANDREW</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;I</span> FEEL,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;that some one
ought to pat me on the back. I set out to
do something, and I did it. It is a pleasant
sensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unaccustomed?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason, with
mock sarcasm.</p>

<p>They were both in her studio the day following
the return of the donkey-party. They were
awaiting the appearance of Andrew McAndrew, to
whom Barnabas had written to come to the studio
at four o&rsquo;clock. Pippa had been taken by Jasper
to call upon his wife.</p>

<p>Miss Mason had announced Bridget&rsquo;s advent to
Beaufort Street to the assembled party the previous
evening. They had taken the announcement
without undue surprise. Their minds were too big
and straightforward to dream of questioning.
Since Jasper had chosen to keep the fact of his
marriage secret it was entirely his own affair.
They merely rejoiced that he was now, as Miss
Mason told them, unfeignedly happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aurora,&rdquo; continued Barnabas, &ldquo;has gone
down to stay with her own people for three weeks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>while the banns are being called. She left this
morning, and Alan is writing to her at the moment.
Their pet names for each other are Sweetest and
Boysie. I suppose the pendulum was bound to
swing pretty far in the direction of rank sentimentality.
It&rsquo;ll steady again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You swung it,&rdquo; said Miss Mason dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m proud of the fact,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s Mr. McAndrew,&rdquo; said Miss Mason,
relapsing into her gruffest manner, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to
do the talking, because I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. McAndrew,&rdquo; said Sally, opening the door.</p>

<p>Andrew came in, a great loose-limbed fellow,
with mouse-coloured hair, and oddly earnest eyes
in a snub-nosed, wide-mouthed face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awfully glad to see you, McAndrew,&rdquo; said
Barnabas warmly. &ldquo;Let me introduce you to
Miss Mason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two shook hands and Andrew sat down.
His glance wandered round the studio till it
reached the &ldquo;Winged Victory.&rdquo; His eyes rested
on it with pleasure as on some familiar friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but yon&rsquo;s a fine bit o&rsquo; wor-rk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of sculpture,&rdquo; said Miss Mason
shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed,&rdquo; said Andrew, &ldquo;I like it weel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you do anything yourself in that way?&rdquo;
asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>Andrew shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no be havin&rsquo; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for mair than juist dabblin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
a bit o&rsquo; clay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to give your time to the
work?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed an&rsquo; I wad.&rdquo; There was a simple
earnestness about the words infinitely more convincing
than any lengthy assurance of the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Mason gruffly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have
some tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the meal Barnabas did most of the
talking, Andrew replying in short sentences. Miss
Mason was practically silent. When it was finished
Miss Mason looked across at Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better tell Mr. McAndrew our idea,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>So, very straightforwardly, Barnabas told Andrew
Miss Mason&rsquo;s scheme for the Wonderful
Chance. When he had ended Andrew looked at
him with an expression of dumb happiness in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be meanin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
were thinkin&rsquo; to offer the chance to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you care to take it,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m maist obleeged,&rdquo; said Andrew, and he
lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Miss Mason gruffly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s settled. Mr. Kirby will make all arrangements
with you.&rdquo; And she too became silent.</p>

<p>It was not at all the kind of interview Barnabas
had intended. He felt Miss Mason to be almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>tiresomely gruff, and his protg almost ungrateful.</p>

<p>At last Andrew heaved himself out of his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be leavin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. He held out his hand
to Miss Mason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m maist obleeged,&rdquo; he said
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Miss Mason gruffly.</p>

<p>Barnabas went out into the little garden with
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason doesn&rsquo;t mean to be abrupt,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely her manner. She finds it difficult
to express&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew turned on him. &ldquo;Man, d&rsquo;ye think I
dinna ken. D&rsquo;ye think &lsquo;I&rsquo;m maist obleeged&rsquo; told
juist all that was in ma heart. I cud e&rsquo;en ha&rsquo; knelt
an&rsquo; ha&rsquo; kissed the hem o&rsquo; her skir-rt. An&rsquo; gin I
had I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been sobbin&rsquo; like a wee bit wean.&rdquo; Andrew
swallowed once or twice fiercely.</p>

<p>Then he saw the little faun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yon&rsquo;s bonny. I wad like fine
to make a figure to stand in t&rsquo; auld lady&rsquo;s garden,
but aiblins she like it a wee bit draipit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charity,&rdquo; laughed Barnabas, &ldquo;colossal and in
many robes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Andrew scornfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ha&rsquo; gran&rsquo;
figure o&rsquo; Charity I was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;, but juist a wee
figure o&rsquo; smilin&rsquo; Love wi&rsquo; his hands held oot to
draw folk to his hearrt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And a year later such a little figure did stand&mdash;not
in the garden&mdash;but in a corner of Miss
Mason&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>When Andrew had gone Barnabas went back into
the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We disappointed you,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s no more good at expressing his feelings
than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Barnabas lightly. &ldquo;He
managed though to say a bit more in the garden.
By the way,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;no one has called to
claim the ring yet, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Miss Mason. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer
ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barnabas. But for some reason he
still did not say where and when he had first
seen it.</p>

<span class="ph3">THE CRUELTY OF THE FATES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Duchessa di Corleone was on her way
back from Italy. She had said good-bye
with a little pang to the gallery, and to the courtyard
with its golden oranges and marble statues,
but once on her way to England the thought of
Paul completely obliterated any trace of sorrow.
She was joyfully ready to give up everything&mdash;the
Casa di Corleone, her house on the Embankment,
and her thousands a year for the man who
had taken her heart into his keeping.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey her heart sang little
songs of happiness, which had as their refrain the
one word, &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo; The express train rushing
across the country bathed in the July sun could
hardly carry her with sufficient swiftness. When,
at last, Calais was reached and she was on board
the boat she felt happier.</p>

<p>With the cliffs of Dover in sight her heart was
singing a Te Deum. Till that moment she had
felt that some accident might happen to prevent
her getting to him. Now, in less than four hours
she would be in his studio.</p>

<p>She had written to tell him not to meet her at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>the station. She wanted their first meeting to be
alone, without the eyes of curious porters upon
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just you and I together, my darling,&rdquo; she
wrote. &ldquo;I can see the room in my mind, and you
coming forward to meet me. There has not been
a moment day and night when you have been absent
from my thoughts. Our love transfigures
everything for me. Life has become a magic book
on every page of which your name is written....&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That letter had reached Paul in his studio the
morning of the day Sara would arrive. And now,
an hour before her arrival, he was sitting with it
crumpled tightly in his hand, his eyes staring
blankly before him.</p>

<p>The Fates had struck suddenly, dealing sorrow
as they had dealt joy, silently and swiftly. That
very morning he had heard of the complete failure
of the Mexican bank in which his money was
invested.</p>

<p>At first the news had stunned him. In the
afternoon he had gone down to a friend in the
city to make fuller enquiries. He found his worst
fears realized. His income, which altogether had
amounted to about fourteen hundred a year, had
been suddenly reduced to less than half. In fact,
to merely the six hundred or so he earned by his
painting.</p>

<p>Paul went back to his studio and sat down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>trying to realize what it would mean. And
because he was a man whose steady grey eyes
had always looked facts clearly in the face, he
even took pencil and paper and jotted down certain
figures. But the sum total always remained the
same&mdash;his marriage with Sara had become
impossible.</p>

<p>He never for an instant did her the wrong of
thinking that his loss of income would make any
difference to her love for him. He believed in her
love as implicitly as he believed in his own.
That, however, did not alter the one fact that
marriage was out of the question. Even if he
reduced his mother&rsquo;s allowance by a hundred a
year&mdash;which, however, he had no intention of
doing&mdash;the three hundred left him would not
justify him taking any woman to wife, and
assuredly not a woman like the Duchessa di
Corleone. He knew the impossibility of transplanting
a hot-house flower to the open air of a
wintry garden. The thing could not be done. No
amount of care could save it; it must die.</p>

<p>And with the irony of fate, this news had
reached him by the very same post as her letter.</p>

<p>He took it again from his pocket and re-read it.
A spasm of pain that was almost physical pierced
him. His hand tightened on the paper till it was
crumpled and twisted. And in less than an hour
she would be in the studio with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; said Paul to himself, &ldquo;the Fates are
very cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then because throughout the day his first
thought had been of Sara he began to plan how
best to break the news to her. He determined
that for a few hours at least she should not know.
She should have the complete joy of the meeting
unmarred. They were going out to dine together.
When they returned to the studio it would be time
enough to tell her. With the decision all the old
quiet endurance he had learnt through days and
nights of hardship came back to Paul. He would
hide the knowledge of their parting in his own
heart. Till he bade her good-bye that evening she
should never guess what the world would really
mean to them both.</p>

<p>Something caught at his throat and a mist swam
before his eyes. He got up and began to walk
quickly up and down the room. Every now and
then his hand, still holding the letter, clenched
tightly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized what he held. He stopped
in his walk and put the letter on the table. He
smoothed it out tenderly, as if it had been some
living thing he had injured. He folded it and put
it in his pocket-book. And once more he began his
walk.</p>

<p>The whole place seemed full of her presence.
Everything reminded him of her, the chair in
which she sat, the glass at which she had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>wont to arrange her hat when she was sitting for
him, the vases on a bookshelf, for which she
insisted that he should buy flowers. There were
flowers in them to-day, real crimson roses&mdash;General
Jacqueminot, with its sweet old-fashioned
scent. For the future they would remain empty.
It would be useless to buy flowers if she was not
to see them. It seemed to him as if his whole life
he had been doing everything for her, and that
now nothing would seem worth while. He caught
at his underlip with his teeth, biting it hard. It
seemed as if he were being asked to bear more than
human strength could endure. Then all at once
he stopped in his walk, for the hoot of a taxi near
at hand struck on his ears.</p>

<p>A moment later he heard a light step crossing
the courtyard. The door opened. She was in the
doorway&mdash;radiant, living.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in his arms. He was holding her as if
he would never let her go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Love, so say the chroniclers&mdash;and wrongly&mdash;is
blind. It is keen-sighted as an eagle, which from
afar discerns objects invisible to the sight of man.</p>

<p>When Paul at last held Sara away from him,
she looked into his eyes, and though he had hidden
his sorrow deep down in his heart she saw suddenly
into the depths, and her own heart momentarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>stood still. But also with her love and her
quick woman&rsquo;s instinct she saw that it was something
he wished to keep hidden, and so she did not
ask him then what it was he was hiding from her,
but smiled at him, and in her turn hid what she had
guessed.</p>

<p>So throughout the evening the two played a
game of pretence, she knowing that they both were
playing it, and he&mdash;man-like&mdash;believing that he
was the sole performer.</p>

<p>They went to an hotel together and dined, and
listened to a band which was making music, and
they talked nonsensically about the food they were
eating and the people they saw, and all the time her
heart was crying to him to drop the terrible mask
of gaiety and tell her his sorrow. But as she saw
he meant to play the game she told him of her
journey, and the portrait that was hanging in the
gallery, and she said that she had kissed the fauns
good-bye. And then quite suddenly she stopped,
because she saw a look of such pain come into his
eyes that for the moment she was dumb, and
pretence seemed useless. But almost at once he
laughed and made some little light speech; and she
laughed too, and bravely, because she knew he
wished it.</p>

<p>But when at last they were back in the studio
she could play the terrible little game no longer.
And he too knew that the moment had come for it
to cease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; she said steadily, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guessed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, with a sad laugh, &ldquo;I knew
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the harlequin game has been no good,&rdquo;
he said. And so he told her. And when he had
ended there was a long silence.</p>

<p>Sara was the first to break it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need for me to tell you,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that this makes no difference to our
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Paul, and in spite of himself his
voice was bitter, &ldquo;it does to our marriage. There
is no way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with the words silence again fell. And
in the silence Sara felt a slow hatred of Giuseppe
creep into her heart. He could have made this
happiness possible to her, and he had made it
impossible.</p>

<p>She did not dream of suggesting that they
should marry in spite of everything. She knew
it would be mere mockery to do so. But her heart
rebelled fiercely against fate and against the late
Duca di Corleone. It was the arrant selfishness
of his deed that angered her. She had been his
wife faithful and courteous when he was living,
and in return he claimed her life when he was dead,
or made a pauper of her.</p>

<p>She got up from her chair and began to move
about the room. In mind and body she felt like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>a caged animal beating against the bars which kept
it from freedom.</p>

<p>She paused near the window. Paul saw her
figure silhouetted against the night sky. He
watched her. And suddenly her love for Paul and
every fighting instinct within her rose up against
the injustice of the Fates. Defiance of their decree
and intense love overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;is a way,&rdquo; she said slowly. She did
not turn her head. Paul saw her profile immovable
against the square of grey-blue window.</p>

<p>He got up from his chair and came across to her.
He took her hand and held it hard against his
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You honour me, Beloved,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it
cannot be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned towards him then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she cried almost fiercely. &ldquo;We
love each other. Is not that enough? Let us defy
Giuseppe. Do you think I care what the world
would say of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I care,&rdquo; said Paul simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you care for me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beloved,&rdquo; said Paul huskily, &ldquo;it is because I
love you&mdash;because you are more than the whole
world to me that I cannot let there be the smallest
stain upon your honour. I&mdash;my God, how I
worship you!&rdquo; The words came from him like a
cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Paul.&rdquo; The bitterness in her heart had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>melted, and with it her strength. He held her in
his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was&mdash;was I horrible?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He kissed her lips fiercely. &ldquo;You were wonderful,
my darling. God knows the generosity of
women. But there are some sacrifices a man cannot
accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been none,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>He held her closer. &ldquo;You think not now, my
darling. But later&mdash;&mdash; Dearest, I could not bear
to see your whiteness stained by the mud the world
would throw at you.&rdquo; He kissed her eyes and
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be the end of it?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed sadly. &ldquo;There is only one thing left
for us to do&mdash;we must say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her arms round him. &ldquo;Ah, not that,
Paul&mdash;not that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But listen, dearest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to look at things as they are. There is no profession
open to me in which I am likely to make
more than I can by my painting. I have lost
every penny of capital. God! how sordid it
seems that the lack of money should keep us
apart. But there it is. It may be years before
I make more, though Heaven knows I&rsquo;d paint
every commonplace creature in creation in return
for shekels now. I hate my own fastidiousness.
I&rsquo;ve lost dozens of commissions and made not a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>few enemies. It will take ages to make up for
my folly. At the best it must be years before I
have anything like a decent income.&rdquo; He stopped.
He had loathed having to speak the bare commonplace
facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was shaking,
&ldquo;it would not be fair to let you. There will be
other men, rich, who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She interrupted by a gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you count my love as little as that?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Cannot you understand that there is
nothing in the world for me but my love for you
and your love for me. If you believe as I do that
we belong to each other for time and eternity, then
how can you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; She could get no further.
He stopped her with such kisses that she was
frightened at his vehemence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We belong to each other.
One day I will claim you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And till then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a time,&rdquo; he said steadily, &ldquo;we must not
meet. It is&mdash;wiser not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;of what I said?&rdquo; she asked. The
crimson colour had covered her face and neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;but because I am
only a man, and very human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was something in his voice that told
her not to gainsay him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at least we will write,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be almost the same as seeing you.
There would come a day when the sight of your
writing would shake my resolve. You, if you
wrote, could only tell me all that was in your heart.
What use else to write? I should hear your heart
calling mine, as mine will call to you. And then
one day my resolution would fail. And if it did
I should hate myself, and count myself unworthy
to come near you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then never, dear heart,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>And there was a little silence too sad for words
or tears. It was Sara who broke it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher used to say,&rdquo; she said, with a little
shaky laugh, &ldquo;that I could cheat the Fates. This
time I cannot. They have dealt me a hand full of
little spades, and every one of them is digging the
grave of my happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dearest,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She disengaged herself gently from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And since for a time at least we both must
die,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we had better die at once. A
lingering death is so painful.&rdquo; Her voice shook.
&ldquo;Good-bye, Paul. Don&rsquo;t come with me. I want
to go home alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again their eyes met. And he caught her to
him. She felt his body shaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he took her to the door and held it
open for her. She went out through the courtyard
in the twilight of the summer evening.</p>

<p>And the little faun, holding his pipe to his lips,
made no sound, for he knew at that moment no
music however tender could bring comfort to her
heart.</p>

<span class="ph3">IN YORKSHIRE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>WAY in Yorkshire, on a fell-side, a woman
was sitting on a grey stone and looking at the
landscape before her.</p>

<p>Below her, some couple of hundred feet, ran a
little brown stream, on the banks of which a man
in tweed clothes was walking. He held a fishing-rod,
and every now and then he paused to cast a
fly upon the water with a light and dexterous
hand.</p>

<p>The woman watched him idly. Later he would
join her by a clump of trees near the stream, and
they would have luncheon together. The man&rsquo;s
name was Luke Preston, and he was her husband.
They had been married exactly a fortnight
previously, and were now spending part of their
honeymoon in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The landscape, and particularly the sight of
the distant figure by the stream, gave her a great
sense of rest. In some ways Luke was like the
fells around her she thought&mdash;very big, very
silent, and very enduring. It was the unwavering
assurance of Luke that had first attracted him
to her. There was something so unswerving about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>his point of view. It was so direct. There were
never more than two ways in his mind&mdash;the right
and the wrong; never more than two colours&mdash;black
and white. There were no little chance bypaths,
and no shades of grey admissible. Because
of this some people found Luke lacking in
subtlety, but to the woman he had married it
constituted a strength which she found very
pleasant.</p>

<p>All her life she had been swayed by varying
moods. Actions seldom appeared to her in a light
of her own opinion. They became black, white, or
various shades of lighter or darker grey as they
were presented to her by the minds of others.
There was one episode only in her life in which she
had resolutely adhered to her own determination.
And that episode was one she wished to forget, or
to remember only as a dream, and not as a time
connected with her own waking self.</p>

<p>It had all happened a good many years ago, and
some people have a curious faculty for disconnecting
themselves mentally from their own past
actions. Sybil Preston was one of these. During
the years that had elapsed since the episode she had
had one thing only to remind her of it&mdash;a quaint
signet ring, with which she had never had the
courage to part.</p>

<p>On the way up to Yorkshire, the very day of
her wedding, she had lost it. She fancied it must
have slipped from her finger as she had waved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>to a small girl swinging on a gate. But she had
not discovered her loss till the evening when they
had stopped for the night at an hotel. In a sense
she regretted the loss, yet on the other hand she
could not help feeling it a relief. She regarded it
in a way as a kind of omen&mdash;a sign that the past
was banished forever, especially as the loss had
occurred on the very day she had entered her new
life.</p>

<p>The episode was known only to herself and to
one other living person&mdash;a woman friend of hers.
She had no smallest fear but that Cecily Mainwaring
had kept silence regarding it&mdash;would
always keep silence. She was a woman with
extraordinary strength of character and great
reserve. She had always been a staunch friend
of Sybil&rsquo;s. Sybil herself had sometimes marvelled
that in this matter she had been able to stand
firm against Cecily&rsquo;s opinion; in fact, to persuade
her to her own point of view regarding it.
Though, to be strictly truthful, Cecily had never
adopted Sybil&rsquo;s point of view, she had acted
contrary to her own judgment, and purely from
her unswerving friendship to Sybil. They had
never again referred to the matter. Sybil had seen
considerably less of Cecily after it. She had never
felt entirely comfortable in her presence. Cecily&rsquo;s
eyes were too terribly truthful. They were not
unlike Luke&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>Sybil, sitting up on the moorland, heaved an
enormous sigh of relief at the thought that he
could never have the smallest suspicion of that
episode. She knew that deceit of any kind was
the one thing Luke could never forgive. She
knew, however, that she was perfectly safe. She
would soon be safe herself from all memory of
it. To-morrow they were returning to London,
and a month hence they were sailing for India.
Luke was in the Indian Civil Service, and would
be returning after a year&rsquo;s leave. For some years
at least they would be out of England, and there
would be no chance of meeting Cecily, who just
served to remind her of things she now wanted to
forget entirely.</p>

<p>And then she saw her husband winding in his
line and waving to her. She got up and went down
the side of the fell towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been lonely, little girl?&rdquo; he asked, putting his
arm round her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got five beauties. We&rsquo;ll
have them for supper to-night. Now come along
and have some lunch. I&rsquo;m simply ravenous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; laughed Sybil. &ldquo;What a glorious
place it is, and how delicious the air is, and how
utterly happy I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; he said, and bent to kiss her.</p>

<p>They walked towards the clump of trees where
Luke had left a knapsack containing various
eatables. They were simple enough&mdash;a couple of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>packets of sandwiches, a couple of pieces of cake,
and a flask of claret. He was not the man to
burden himself with unnecessary food.</p>

<p>Sybil sat down on the grass, leaning back against
a tree-trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could stay on here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
would be infinitely pleasanter than going back to
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infinitely,&rdquo; said Luke, taking a great bite of
chicken sandwich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not write and tell your people that
we can&rsquo;t come, and that we&rsquo;re staying on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke laughed. &ldquo;Because, darling, there is no
earthly reason beyond our own inclination to
prevent us going back to London. And I promised
my parents that we would come to them during the
last part of July. They go down to Henley in
August, and their cottage is too small to take us
in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil pouted. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get out of it,
though?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could sprain my ankle, or
break my leg, or something, and be unable to
travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you say
that, Sybil. Of course you don&rsquo;t mean it, but that
you should even suggest in fun that you could make
an untrue statement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil interrupted him quickly. &ldquo;Of course I
didn&rsquo;t mean it, Luke darling. It was only rather
a stupid bit of nonsense. I wouldn&rsquo;t break our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>promise for worlds, and you know I love your
people. It was just the thought of this heavenly
place that tempted me. Besides, I have you to
myself up here. I&rsquo;m not sharing you with anyone.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The last two sentences were the outcome of
genuine affection on Sybil&rsquo;s part. She was
honestly devoted to her big husband. And
though at times she would have preferred him to
be a little less literal, his strength and assurance
of purpose, as already mentioned, appealed to her
enormously.</p>

<p>Her last two sentences, in fact her whole speech,
pleased Luke. He patted her hand and looked at
her with tender eyes. He loved her from the very
bottom of his extremely truthful heart. He had
placed her carefully on a little pedestal of his own
building, and her first remark had distressed him,
as it had caused her to sway a trifle unsteadily on
the same pedestal.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished lunch he returned
to his fishing, and she strolled across some fields to
a little pond in a bit of heathery moorland, where
she found some sundew and a bog violet.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock before they went
back to the little white cottage in the small village.
They found that the evening post had come in, and
with it a couple of letters and a London paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder why this has been sent?&rdquo; asked Luke,
opening it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been eschewing London
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>papers since we&rsquo;ve been up here. The &lsquo;Yorkshire
Post&rsquo; is quite good enough on a holiday.&rdquo; He
turned the pages. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Talbot&rsquo;s wedding&rdquo;&mdash;Talbot
had been his best man. &ldquo;Ah, well,
that kind of rigmarole will interest you far more
than me. I&rsquo;ve no use for other people&rsquo;s weddings.
I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my own. Eh! little
girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil laughed, returned his kiss, and went upstairs
to take off her hat.</p>

<p>Later in the evening she took up the paper, and
because she had nothing else to read she studied
the pages rather carefully. Suddenly an advertisement
caught her eye. She read it slowly, then put
down the paper. It told her that her ring had been
found, and that she could get it by applying at a
certain address.</p>

<p>For a moment she decided that she would take
no notice of the advertisement. Then it occurred
to her that there might be the smallest element
of risk in leaving the ring in other hands. It was
certainly unique, and once seen not likely to be
forgotten. No doubt other people had seen and
observed it long before it had come into her
hands&mdash;people who had known its previous
owner.</p>

<p>They were going back to London to-morrow.
If Luke saw the advertisement he would at once
recognize it as a description of the ring she had
worn. She had told him that Cecily had given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>it to her. He had mentioned it once to Cecily as
her gift to Sybil. Sybil remembered the tiny trace
of scorn in Cecily&rsquo;s eyes at the lie, though she had
not contradicted the statement.</p>

<p>If Luke saw the advertisement he would
promptly go and fetch the ring for her, and then
there was no knowing whether he would not learn
something of its previous history. She knew it
was ridiculous to imagine such a thing, and yet she
felt that she dared run no tiniest risk.</p>

<p>Whoever had found the ring was advertising
the fact assiduously, for the loss was now a fortnight
old. They might continue to advertise.
The moment she got back to London she would
go to the address given by Mr. Kirby and claim
the ring. And perhaps on the way out to India
she would drop it overboard. She wanted to
forget. Whatever Sybil&rsquo;s faults and weaknesses
she was genuinely in love with Luke.</p>

<p>She crumpled the paper in her hand, managing
to tear the advertisement. She would run no risk.</p>

<p>Luke looked up with a big yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read the account of the wedding?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;They were going to Biarritz, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I want all I can get out of old
England. I don&rsquo;t have too much of her. And
now, little girl, how about bed?&rdquo; He heaved
himself out of his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;did you read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>the account of the exhibition of pictures at the
Grafton Galleries? I see there&rsquo;s a portrait exhibited
there by a fellow named John Kirby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil thought of the advertisement and her heart
stood suddenly still, then began to race furiously,
though she had no real notion why it was doing so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the man?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were at school together,&rdquo; said Luke.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him occasionally since then. He took
up painting. I haven&rsquo;t looked him up this time
or let him know I was in England&mdash;don&rsquo;t know
why. If I&rsquo;ve time I might look him up before I
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The simple statement troubled Sybil. She
felt that she must get the ring from Mr. Kirby
before her husband should see him. She had no
reason for feeling this, but the idea was strong upon
her, though she told herself it was entirely absurd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking tired, little girl,&rdquo; said Luke
solicitously. &ldquo;Hope you didn&rsquo;t overwalk to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy, that&rsquo;s
all. I&rsquo;ll go up now and leave you to have your
last pipe in the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left the room and Luke strolled into the
garden, where he smoked under the quiet stars, and
sniffed the night air, and watched the light in
Sybil&rsquo;s room with a feeling of great content. The
world, in his opinion, was an extraordinarily
pleasant place.</p>

<span class="ph3">PIPPA&rsquo;S MOTHER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ISS Mason was in her studio having tea.
Barnabas was with her. He invariably
dropped in at tea-time unless he was giving a tea-party
on his own account.</p>

<p>Pippa had gone with Alan to look at flats. The
occupation was an intense joy to her. If he had
decided on all the flats on which she had set her
heart he would have taken at least a dozen, and he
and Aurora would have lived in one at a time
during each of the twelve months of the year.
Hitherto, notwithstanding Pippa&rsquo;s enthusiasm
regarding them, he had not found one that quite
came up to his requirements. Tea being finished,
Barnabas lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must take you to call on Mrs. McAndrew
soon,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;She and Andrew have
got a minute flat quite close to his studio. She&rsquo;s
a delightful old lady. You will like her, and her
Scotch is, if anything, broader than Andrew&rsquo;s.
I&rsquo;ve never seen a fellow so gloriously happy as he
is. We look upon you, Aunt Olive, as a kind of
fairy godmother, who has only to touch people&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>lives with a magic wand to ensure their happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason laughed gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is quite the nicest thing I&rsquo;ve
ever had said to me. I know my own life has been
a kind of glorious fairy tale lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;is a fairy tale, if only
one can believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Aunt Olive, &ldquo;one comes in touch
with bad fairies on occasions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; nodded Barnabas gravely. &ldquo;But
I fancy there are some people who have the magic
wand that can transform them into good ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a comfortable belief,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>Sally opened the studio door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady to see Mr. Kirby, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She says she has come about an advertisement of
a ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said Barnabas, and he got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show her in,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. And the next
minute Sybil Preston entered the studio. Halfway
into the room she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granny!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Mason got up from her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; she said in an excited voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
little Sybil Quarly. Sally, bring fresh tea at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil sat down by the table in a chair put for her
by Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the extraordinary things,&rdquo; she laughed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>&ldquo;that I should walk quietly into this studio and
find you. It must be fifteen years since we met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And eleven since I heard from you,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason.</p>

<p>Sybil flushed faintly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shocking letter
writer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never write letters. But
indeed I had not forgotten you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;So the
ring is yours. Just fancy that through your
losing it, and Mr. Kirby&rsquo;s advertisement, we should
meet again. I&rsquo;ve got it quite safely for you.&rdquo;
She got up and took it from a small box. &ldquo;Here
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil held out her hand for it. Suddenly she
became aware that Barnabas was watching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she said to him, with a little
nervous laugh, &ldquo;that you know my husband, Luke
Preston. He was speaking of you only the other
day, and saying that he must look you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas smiled. &ldquo;What, old Luke!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course I knew him. We were at
school together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are married?&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barely three weeks ago. We went to Yorkshire
for part of our honeymoon. It was on the
way up I lost my ring. We were quite rural up
there, and saw no papers but the &lsquo;Yorkshire
Post.&rsquo; It was only by chance that a London paper
was sent us, and I saw the advertisement, so
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>She broke off. She had suddenly seen the
picture of Pippa standing by the faun. Both
figures were life-size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is that?&rdquo; Her eyes were
dilated, her breath coming quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Pippa,&rdquo; said Miss Mason; &ldquo;a little girl
I have adopted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas was again watching Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;extraordinarily like
a man I once knew, a great friend of mine&mdash;Philippe
Kostolitz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil stared at him with wide eyes. There was
a trace of fear in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew Philippe?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barnabas, still quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Mason&rsquo;s keen old eyes looked from one to
the other of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you know
of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil gave a little sob. &ldquo;He&mdash;he was my
husband,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room. Then
Miss Mason put a question. It seemed forced from
her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil bowed her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go away?&rdquo; asked Barnabas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, stay,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;I suppose you guessed
something the moment I came to claim the ring.
Since you knew Philippe you must have known it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>belonged to him. You had better hear the story.
God knows what I am going to do now.&rdquo; Her lips
quivered. She looked like a piteous, frightened
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason gently, &ldquo;if there
is any way in which we can help you, we will. Tell
us as much as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil drew a long breath. She looked at Miss
Mason. She tried to forget that Barnabas was
present, though she wished him to remain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that we went to live
at Pangbourne. A year after we went there I
met Philippe. He was staying with some friends
near us. We saw a good bit of each other one way
and another, and&mdash;and we began to care....</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother must have guessed it, for she
suddenly began to prevent my seeing him. But
one day he came straight to my father and said
he loved me.... My father was furious. He
said he would never hear of his daughter marrying
a vagabond artist, a man who spent half his life
on the roads like any tramp, and the other half
in a studio messing with common clay. You
know my father never did like art, and he looked
on all artists with contempt. He never believed
that they were gentlemen. You know, he never
believed that anyone who did anything for their
livelihood was one. And he couldn&rsquo;t conceive it
possible that the love of the work and not money
was Philippe&rsquo;s motive in his art. At any rate, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>sent Philippe away. I was quite miserable, but
hadn&rsquo;t the courage to gainsay him, and my mother
was quite as bad....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six months later I was staying with some
friends in Hampshire for a fortnight. I was to go
on from there to another friend&mdash;Cecily Mainwaring&mdash;for
a month. Cecily lives in London.
One day while I was in Hampshire I was out for a
walk alone, when I met Philippe....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no use my trying to tell you how
glad I was to see him. When he knew I was staying
at Andover he remained in the neighbourhood,
and we used to meet almost daily. I&rsquo;d always
gone for long walks alone. We used to spend
hours together in Harewood Forest, and he used
to make all kinds of plans. First he wanted me
to defy my parents and run away with him and
marry him. But I hadn&rsquo;t the courage. I said
that perhaps in time they&rsquo;d consent. Then he
thought of another plan and begged me to consent
to it. We were to be married and keep it a secret
from my people. I was to spend a month with
him in some little country place instead of staying
with Cecily. Then I was to go home, and he was
to come down and use all his influence with my
parents, and if it failed we would have to tell
them. He begged me so that at last I consented.
At the back of my mind I thought that if my
parents were still obdurate I could persuade
Philippe not to tell them. At least I&rsquo;d have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>month with him. I wasn&rsquo;t nineteen, and I never
though of what&mdash;what might happen....&rdquo; She
stopped, her face crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo; said Miss Mason gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philippe went away then to make arrangements,
and I stayed on three days longer with
my friends. I left them ostensibly to go to Cecily.
I met Philippe instead.... We were married
at a tiny church. He had got a special license.
He didn&rsquo;t like it not being his own church, but
as I was a Catholic it would have been difficult
to arrange that. At all events, the marriage was
legal, and he thought that perhaps we&rsquo;d be
married again in his own church when my parents
knew. But of course that didn&lsquo;t trouble me. We
went to Wales together, to a little village there.
Any letters that might be written to me went to
Cecily. I wrote to her and told her I was on a
motor tour with friends and my visit to her must
be postponed; that I wasn&rsquo;t sure when I could come
home to her. And I asked her to keep any letters
for me till I came. Cecily was quite unsuspecting,
and did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was gloriously happy with Philippe. Occasionally
I was frightened at what I had done,
but when he was with me I only thought about
him and my happiness. One day he went into
Shrewsbury by train.... I was going with him,
but I had such a bad headache that at the last
moment I persuaded him to go alone. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>to have come back at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening....
He didn&rsquo;t come, and I got uneasy. I went
down towards the station.... Then I heard
there had been a frightful railway accident only
three miles outside the station.... I went to
the place.... I don&rsquo;t know how I got there.
Ever so many people were going.... They
carried the people from the train to cottages and
barns.... I found Philippe in one of them....&rdquo;
Sybil&rsquo;s voice shook and she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know, dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
try to tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little silence. At last Sybil went
on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I saw that he was dead I suddenly
realized what I had done. I knew there was no
one to stand between me and my parents&rsquo; anger....
And then men came who began to ask questions
of the people present ... wanting them to
identify....&rdquo; Again Sybil stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran away,&rdquo; she went on pitifully. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t bear to be asked anything. I thought
perhaps no one would ever know. I thought it
would be so much easier if they didn&rsquo;t.... I
got back to the cottage and packed a few things....
All the people were out at&mdash;at the place.
We had given them an assumed name. I thought
they&rsquo;d never know who we were.... Of course,
afterwards they knew about Philippe, I suppose,
when he was identified. I saw in the papers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>that letters were found on him.... Someone
went there, a friend of his. I&rsquo;ve forgotten the
name....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;It is strange that
there was no mention of you. I suppose the people
at the rooms where you stayed wished to keep out
of being questioned, so did not come forward.
However, that&rsquo;s no matter now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left money to pay for our lodging,&rdquo; went
on Sybil, &ldquo;and just ran away. I walked a long
distance to another little station and took a train
to Hereford. From there I went to London. I
got there in the early morning. I waited about
in the station till nearly lunch-time. Then I
drove to Cecily&rsquo;s flat. I had sent my luggage&mdash;at
least most of it&mdash;to her from Andover. I&rsquo;d
only taken a little box and a handbag to Wales.
I left the box behind at the rooms. There was
nothing in it that could betray my name. I took
the handbag away with me. When I saw Cecily
I just said that the tour had ended unexpectedly,
and that I hadn&rsquo;t been well. I stayed with her a
week. That week and the three weeks in Wales
just made up the month I was supposed to be with
her. Then I went home....</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use trying to explain what I thought,
nor how wretched I was. I don&rsquo;t think I quite
knew myself. It didn&rsquo;t seem I who was acting,
but just something or somebody outside myself.
If I really thought of anything it was only that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>I could never face my parents&rsquo; anger. So all the
time I was planning and thinking how best to behave
that they should never know. It sounds
dreadful now, but then it didn&rsquo;t seem fair that I
should only have three weeks&rsquo; happiness, and for
that bear the whole brunt of their anger alone. I
soon found that I need not fear them guessing.
They never suspected that I had not been with
Cecily the whole time.... As the weeks passed I
began to think myself that everything that had happened
had been a dream.... It wasn&rsquo;t exactly
that I forgot Philippe, only I tried to pretend it
had never been a reality.... And then all at once
I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a dream ... that it never
had been ... and no amount of thinking could
turn it into one.... I used to pass whole nights
of terror wondering what I could do.... If I had
only told my parents at once it would have been so
much easier.... Even though they would have
been terribly angry, at least I was married to
Philippe.... But now I felt I could never tell
them....</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last I thought of Cecily. I wrote to ask
her to let me stay with her. I went; and then I
told her everything.... Cecily was very good to
me. She begged and implored me to tell my people,
but I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I cried so much she thought
I&rsquo;d be ill, and at last she promised to help me and
do everything I wanted.... We went over to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>France. My father was quite willing for me to
travel about with Cecily, and kept me well supplied
with money. We were in France moving about in
different places the whole winter. In March we
took rooms at St. Germain.... It&mdash;it was there
the child was born.... I wouldn&rsquo;t see it.... I
didn&rsquo;t even want to know if it were a boy or a
girl ... but Cecily would tell me. She had it
christened Philippa.... I didn&rsquo;t want to see it because
I didn&rsquo;t want to get fond of it. The nurse
thought it was just queerness on my part because I
was so weak. Cecily arranged everything. Just
after the nurse left, and when I was well enough to
travel, she took the baby away.... I was so glad
when it went. Its crying always reminded me that
it was there. It made me remember, and I wanted
so dreadfully to forget....</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Cecily came back to me alone I told
her we&rsquo;d never speak of it again.... We never
have.... I sent her money.... My father always
gave me a good dress allowance. Out of
that I paid for the child.... I wanted it to be in
France. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of it speaking
with a common English accent....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas, who had been looking on the ground
during most of the recital, now looked up quickly.
What an extraordinary anomaly the woman was.
She could banish from her mind all memory of
the man she had loved, she could forsake the child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>he had given her, and yet she could not bear the
thought of its learning to speak with a common
accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; asked Miss Mason, &ldquo;any idea
where the child was left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Paris,&rdquo; said Sybil quickly. &ldquo;Cecily told
me the name of the woman when she came back.
I didn&rsquo;t want to know, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to stop
her. It was Madame Barbin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason sighed. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there
is no question but that the child who came to my
studio last December is your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil looked at the picture. &ldquo;She is exactly
like Philippe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me how she came
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Miss Mason told the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must write to Cecily and tell her to stop sending
money to Madame Fournier,&rdquo; said Sybil when
she had ended.</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence. It was broken
by Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never told
Luke I&rsquo;d been married before. He knows nothing.
And now for the first time in my life I want my
little girl. It&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked straight before her. Her
face had paled a little, and her voice was not quite
steady as she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil drew in her breath quickly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>that. You don&rsquo;t know Luke. He&rsquo;d never forgive
me&mdash;never. And I love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason quietly, &ldquo;are you
sure he wouldn&rsquo;t? Remember, he loves you, and
love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Sybil, with a little laugh that was
almost a sob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a woman. Men aren&rsquo;t like
that. At least, Luke isn&rsquo;t. If he knew I had deceived
him he wouldn&rsquo;t love me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked at Barnabas. Perhaps a
man&rsquo;s judgment in the matter would be of use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Preston is right,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;If
she had told him before she married him it would
have been different. Now&mdash;&mdash; You see, I know
her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Miss Mason, and stopped.
She did not know what to say. For her own sake
she wanted silence. Yet to her candid mind further
deceit was terribly distressing.</p>

<p>Sybil looked from one to the other of them.
She felt almost as if she were in the presence of a
jury awaiting their verdict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;say just how the
situation strikes me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Sybil quietly. She leant back
a little in her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;that you
cannot only look at the right or wrong of the matter
entirely from your own point of view. There
are two other people to be considered&mdash;your husband
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>and the child. Knowing Luke I fear it is a
matter in which he would not forgive the deceit.
He is not a man who would see any extenuating
circumstances in the case. He would not even
understand your having been first persuaded into a
secret marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you understand it?&rdquo; asked Sybil quickly.
There was a little flush of colour in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;I can see the whole
situation very clearly&mdash;your fear of your parents&rsquo;
anger and Philippe&rsquo;s persuasions. It would not be
easy for a woman who loved Philippe to withstand
him. I, who knew him, can understand that.
Luke did not know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Sybil as he stopped. She looked
at him intently. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
understand the rest of my action?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly, no,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
your silence afterwards when it came to your
desertion of his child. I have, though, no right
to sit in judgment on anyone; and please understand
that I&rsquo;m not judging you. But I am quite
sure that Luke would not take a lenient view. If
he forgave at all&mdash;and I honestly doubt his forgiveness&mdash;duty
would make him offer the child
a home. In fact, he would probably insist on your
having the child with you. But,&rdquo; and Barnabas&rsquo;
voice was firm, &ldquo;he would never, forget. And,
however strong his sense of duty, there would always
be a barrier between him and the child. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>would not be good for her. Also there is no question
but that your husband&rsquo;s confidence and happiness
would be destroyed.&rdquo; He stopped. He felt
every word he had said. He was sorry for the
woman, but Luke and Pippa could not be sacrificed,
and to speak now would mean the sacrifice
of both their lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Sybil, her eyes upon the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;having kept
silence, you owe it to your husband to keep silence
still; in fact, for ever. The child has a home now,
and one who cares for her. For her sake, too, I
do not think you should run the risk of taking her
to a home where she would be unwelcome. She is
extraordinarily sensitive. She would feel it now,
and more as she grows older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil looked towards the picture. It showed the
child in three-quarter face. &ldquo;But I want her
now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She looks such a darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas suppressed a slight movement of impatience.
Sybil&rsquo;s sole thought was of herself and
her own wants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are prepared,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to tell
your husband everything? To lose his confidence
and his love, and kill his happiness, and, quite
possibly, have him to go away from you, merely
making you an allowance. For he is quite as likely&mdash;and
I believe more likely&mdash;to do that than accept
the charge of the child. Which do you want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>most&mdash;your child whom you have never seen or
your husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want Luke,&rdquo; said Sybil quickly. &ldquo;At
least, I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas felt considerably like shaking her. He
was determined that if he could prevent it she
should not spoil two lives. He had no belief in
weak and tardy confessions that advantage no one.
He made an appeal to her better self&mdash;if it existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have the strength and courage
to keep silence. Even if you do want your
child now, have the pluck to renounce her for her
sake and Luke&rsquo;s. Remember, that payment of
some kind is always demanded sooner or later for
any debt we owe. This is your payment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil looked silently towards Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t seen
things quite in that light. Also, I was afraid of
having my judgment biassed by my desire to keep
the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curiously enough throughout the conversation
neither Miss Mason nor Barnabas had spoken of
Pippa by name. Instinctively they both felt that
to do so would be to suggest an intimacy to which
Sybil was not entitled.</p>

<p>Sybil looked at the floor for a few moments
without speaking. Then she raised her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will not tell Luke.
He may come to see you, Mr. Kirby. If he does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>please don&rsquo;t tell him of my visit here. But of
course you won&rsquo;t. And,&rdquo; she went on, with a little
pleading note in her voice, &ldquo;please, you two,
don&rsquo;t despise me more than you can help. Some
people seem born strong and not afraid. I&rsquo;ve always
been a coward. I think perhaps if my father
and mother had been a little more lenient with me
when I was a child it would have been different.
But I was timid, and dreaded being shut up in the
dark. So I used to fib to get out of punishment.
And after a time I thought nothing of not speaking
the truth to them. But I suppose you can&rsquo;t understand
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can understand very well,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
She had known the parents.</p>

<p>And Barnabas felt a sudden pity for the woman,
who in spite of her thirty-two years looked little
more than a girl. She was of the fragile flower-like
beauty that would no doubt appeal to a man
of the strength of Kostolitz. At the moment
Barnabas himself would have protected her rather
than have blamed her.</p>

<p>All at once Sybil spoke timidly. &ldquo;Where is
she?&rdquo; she asked, nodding towards the picture.
&ldquo;Could I see her for a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason hesitated, doubtful of the wisdom of
the proceeding. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out now,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sybil gave a tiny sigh. &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s better
not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have promised not to tell
her. Of course, I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>trust me very easily who knew everything. But
truly she shall never know about me. And I&rsquo;ll
never tell Luke either. I see that you are right.
I owe it to him now to keep silence. I&rsquo;ll try to
make him very happy. And&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll take wanting
my little girl as a punishment. I know I deserve
to lose her, and I see that it is impossible for
me to have her and keep Luke&rsquo;s confidence. I
should quite spoil his life and his belief in every
one. If only I had been brave long ago I might
have had my little girl and Luke too. But I will
keep my word now.&rdquo; She said it all like a child
promising to be good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you will, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason
gently. She was desperately sorry for Sybil, and
terribly grieved at the whole situation. Yet she
too saw that silence was now the only possible
thing for them all. And in the end it would be
happier for Sybil too. Possibly she would always
now wish for her child and regret her loss. But
it would be a tender regret, though sad. And she
would keep Luke&rsquo;s love.</p>

<p>And then suddenly from the courtyard they heard
a child&rsquo;s voice. Sybil flushed and looked at Miss
Mason with pleading eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her,&rdquo; said Barnabas. Wisdom or
not, he could not have resisted Sybil&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found a flat, really and truly,&rdquo; she cried,
as she met Barnabas in the garden. &ldquo;It is beautiful,
but quite beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;More beautiful than the others?&rdquo; laughed
Barnabas. &ldquo;But come in now and behave pretty.
Aunt Olive has a lady to tea with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pippa came into the room. Her extraordinary
likeness to Kostolitz made Sybil catch her breath.
For a moment she did not trust herself to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Pippa, with quick recognition.
&ldquo;It is ze lady of ze car. Did you give her ze
ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil held out her hand. &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it. I&rsquo;m glad you found it and kept it
for me.&rdquo; She held the child&rsquo;s hand tight. Pippa
looked at her with her great grey eyes, so like the
dead sculptor&rsquo;s. Memories rushed over Sybil.
The days in the forest, the days in the little Welsh
village crowded back to her mind. She could almost
hear Kostolitz&rsquo;s voice, hear his gay laugh,
and his words of passionate love. Her throat contracted
and tears filled her eyes. Suddenly she
got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go now,&rdquo; she said. Her voice shook
a little. Then an impulse moved her. She held
out the ring to Pippa. &ldquo;Will you have it?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; said Pippa, her face crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May she?&rdquo; said Sybil to Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>Sybil looked again at the picture of the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to ask,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>would remind me. I don&rsquo;t want to forget now.
Not that I ever shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send it to you,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Barnabas
won&rsquo;t mind, will you, Barnabas? Just a
gift from an old friend, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
she said. Then she bent and kissed Pippa.
&ldquo;Good-bye, little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnabas went to the door with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay any longer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she went away in the sunshine, past the
little faun in the next garden, and so out of the
courtyard, and out of the lives she had momentarily
entered.</p>

<p>When she had disappeared Barnabas looked at
the little faun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the only way,&rdquo; he said. And his heart
was sad for the man who had been forgotten by
the woman he had loved. And he wondered if he
knew everything now. If he did he would probably
understand so fully that he would forgive
fully. And then Barnabas went back into the
studio.</p>

<span class="ph3">MICHAEL MAKES MUSIC</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>URING August Miss Mason took Pippa down
to a little seaside place in Devonshire. She
chose it because its name&mdash;Hope&mdash;appealed to
her.</p>

<p>Pippa adored it. She loved the quaint cottages,
and the beach with the tarred nets spread out to
dry, and the kindly fishermen who took her out in
their boats, and who talked to her in a dialect she
could hardly understand. But she understood their
kindness, and they understood her smiles, so they
got on very well together.</p>

<p>Barnabas came down for a fortnight, and Pippa
met him at the station, a thin slip of a child, her
face bronzed with the sun and sea air, and her
eyes holding the hint of mystery he had seen in
the eyes of Kostolitz.</p>

<p>They bathed together, they caught prawns in
seaweedy pools in the rocks, they sat in the
shadow of the cliffs and watched the sea-gulls and
the white-sailed boats on the blue water.</p>

<p>And during these days Barnabas found in Pippa
something that he had not found before&mdash;not
even during the June days when they had wandered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>through the lanes with Pegasus. He found in her
Woman and Companion. She ceased to be merely
Child. He saw the spirit of Kostolitz in her mysterious
eyes. She showed it to him in a hundred
ways&mdash;in her clear joyous love of Nature, in her
fanciful imaginings and delicate thoughts, in her
quick insight into everything that was beautiful.
And with it all she was a child, too, with a child-like
simple faith and trust that was to be her heritage
throughout her life. And because there was
this trait also in Barnabas they found in each other
the most perfect companionship.</p>

<p>Miss Mason watched them together, helped them
prawn, and was radiantly happy. She cared not
at all for the occasional smiles her quaint figure
and costume provoked from other visitors to the
place. And because Pippa was enjoying herself
enormously she remained at Hope throughout September
as well.</p>

<p>The Duchessa di Corleone too had left London
during August. She wandered from place to
place trying to find forgetfulness and not succeeding.</p>

<p>In September she returned to town. She never
went near the studios now, but Michael came often
to see her, and used to make music for her. In it
she found some consolation. And Michael loved
to come to her house, though the sight of her always
gave him pain.</p>

<p>One day after he had been playing to her, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>they were having tea together, he suddenly looked
up at a picture of St. Michael that hung in her
drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; he said, with a little twisted smile,
&ldquo;that my people should have chosen to name me
after the warrior angel.&rdquo; And he glanced from
the strength of the pictured figure at his own
shrunken limbs. His voice was so bitter that Sara
could find no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment&rsquo;s carelessness on the part of a
nursemaid,&rdquo; went on Michael. &ldquo;She dropped me
when I was a baby. You see the result. It makes
it difficult to believe in an over-ruling Providence,
doesn&rsquo;t it? My guardian angel must have been
peculiarly inattentive at the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Sara slowly, &ldquo;that there are
times in the life of every one when it is very difficult
to have faith. Yet, if one loses it one loses all
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost both long ago,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
irony of fate to be born with an acute sense of the
beautiful, and to see one&rsquo;s own repulsiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not repulsive,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;Look at me! Women
are only kind to me out of pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara looked straight at him. &ldquo;There you are
quite wrong,&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel
the smallest pity for you in the sense you mean.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>Your face is quite beautiful, and your music&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my body,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sara calmly, &ldquo;I grant you that it is
extremely trying for you to be lame, and you must
often wish to be strong and big. But you need
not think it makes the smallest difference in our
affection for you.&rdquo; She again looked steadily at
him as she spoke.</p>

<p>Michael looked away from her. &ldquo;But no
woman could love me&mdash;they would shrink from
me,&rdquo; he said. And his face flushed hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;There again you are
quite wrong. I grant that there is a certain type
of woman who is entirely attracted by sinews and
muscles in a man. But most assuredly there are
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then Michael spoke again.
His voice was very low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you could never care?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Sara&rsquo;s eyes filled with quick tears. &ldquo;Not in the
way you mean,&rdquo; she said gently; &ldquo;but not because
of the morbid reason you have suggested. I&mdash;I
love some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Sara bowed her head.</p>

<p>Michael was silent. &ldquo;But if you did not,&rdquo; he
asked suddenly, &ldquo;would you have thought it horrible
of me to tell you that I love you&mdash;not quietly
and calmly, but&mdash;but as a man loves a woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been honoured to hear it from

you,&rdquo; said Sara.</p>

<p>Michael looked across at her with a strange smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall not tell you
how&mdash;though you know it. Nor shall I ever tell
any other woman what I have told you. You will
still let me come and see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come,&rdquo; said Sara quickly. &ldquo;I
should miss you dreadfully if you didn&rsquo;t. During
these last weeks your visits have been my greatest
pleasure. When I hear the front door bell ring
I listen. And when I hear the pad of your crutch
on the stairs I am happy, and I say to myself, &lsquo;It
is Michael.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had used his name.
For a few moments Michael did not trust himself
to speak. When he did his voice was light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall hate my crutch no longer,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;since its sound has given you happiness. Do
you know you have quite suddenly brought back
faith to me. I thought it was dead. Now I will
play for you again.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE PEACE OF THE RIVER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER Michael had left, Sara went to the window
and stood looking out at the trees on the
Embankment. The heat of the summer had already
caused their leaves to turn yellow.</p>

<p>Beyond them she could see the river. It always
held a note of peace for her. Rivers and lakes had
the power to speak to her. She loved their calm
quietude, though she had seen lakes lashed to fury
by the wind. But it was a different kind of anger
from the anger of the sea. The cruelty of the sea
hurt her&mdash;its restlessness, its turmoil, its never-ceasing
demand for lives. Even when it was quiet
it was treacherous. Its smiling surface was nothing
but a lure, for it held terrible secrets in its
heart.</p>

<p>But the quiet of the river always soothed her.
She knew it in all its moods&mdash;under grey skies,
and under blue skies, in the crimson and purple of
sunset, in the amber grey and rose of dawn. She
knew it at the full flood of its waters, and at ebbing
tide. In all its moods she loved it, and she loved
her house, yet she felt that she could not stay there
much longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>With the end of October she would go away to
Italy for the winter. Everything here reminded
her of Paul. She did not want to forget him, yet
the sight of the streets in which they had walked
together, the hotels at which they had dined, the
theatres to which they had been, only served to
emphasize her present loneliness.</p>

<p>Christopher was the only person who, till to-day,
had known of her unhappiness. Ever since he first
knew her, when she was ten and he was two-and-twenty,
she had come to him with her joys and
griefs. There was a curious faculty for sympathy
in Christopher. It made him the popular barrister
he was, especially with women. It was easy to tell
him things. Had he been a priest he would undoubtedly
have been much sought in confession.
He had heard many stories, both sordid and pitiful.
Somehow he seemed always able to separate
the sin from the sinner. One knew instinctively
that he had no scorn for the latter, any more than
a doctor scorns a patient who comes to him with a
disease to be cured. He had, too, been instrumental
in preventing several divorces, and in giving men
convicted of theft a second chance without the
stigma of prison attaching to them. And curiously
enough he had never been disappointed in those
for whom he had pleaded for leniency. There was
nothing weak about Christopher. There had been
certain cases he had refused to accept&mdash;cases in
which he knew the guilt to be a fact, and in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>justice could only be avoided by a direct wandering
from the truth, even though he knew that by one
of his impassioned speeches he could most probably
have saved the victim from the law, and have established
a great reputation for himself. In spite
of his sympathy, he took a strangely impersonal
view of things in general, and his sympathy, though
very real, was never allowed to bias his judgment.</p>

<p>He agreed fully with Paul&rsquo;s decision that he and
Sara should not meet, and he offered a silent sympathy
which Sara found very comforting. After
she had once told him about the parting she had
not again spoken directly of it. She could not
talk of it. She could only try to live her life as
best she might in the hope that one day....</p>

<p>But that day seemed very far off and dim.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And in his studio Paul was working with a grim,
dogged determination. And every week he wrote
cheerful letters to his mother, in one of which he
had just said that his marriage was postponed for
a time; and he never for a moment let her guess
the trick fate had played him.</p>

<p>And so September passed, and it drew on towards
the middle of October.</p>

<span class="ph3">SOME TWISTED THREADS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;B</span>ARNABAS,&rdquo; said Miss Mason one day&mdash;it
was the fourteenth of October&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the matter with Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in Barnabas&rsquo; studio when she put the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen it too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must be blind not to see it,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason. &ldquo;I felt something was wrong before I
went away, and since I&rsquo;ve been back I&rsquo;ve been sure
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Barnabas did not reply. &ldquo;I know
part,&rdquo; he said after a minute, &ldquo;and the rest I can
guess. You know he has lost a good bit of
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humpt!&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.
So that&rsquo;s the trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;I think the other
part is the Duchessa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; said Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul was in love with her,&rdquo; said Barnabas.</p>

<p>Miss Mason looked at him. Then she nodded
her head two or three times. She suddenly realized
that the Duchessa, who used frequently to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>come to the courtyard, had not been there during
the last three weeks of July, nor during this first
fortnight in October. Of August and September
she had, of course, no record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; went on Barnabas, &ldquo;that if this
money loss had not intervened they would have
followed the example of Aurora and Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cared for him then?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen two people more in love with
each other,&rdquo; said Barnabas. &ldquo;They evidently did
not wish, at the moment, to make the fact public.
But seeing them together, as I occasionally did, one
must have been blind not to have realized it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;Then she is unhappy,
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have happened to meet her twice,&rdquo; said Barnabas.
&ldquo;She acts very well. But the spring of
life has gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she has money,&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she marries again she loses every penny,&rdquo;
said Barnabas. &ldquo;I learned that quite by chance
one day from Charlton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason made a curious sound with her
tongue. It can only be described as clucking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;can be curiously contrary
at times. I&rsquo;m very glad I asked you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she went back to her studio and sat down
for a long time in her big arm-chair to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>And the Three Fates watched her. For when
Miss Mason sat in her chair with just that particular
expression on her face, it meant that she
was not over-pleased with their weaving, and that
she wished to unravel and re-weave their latest
pattern to a fashion more according to their mind.
And the Three Fates looked at each other, and
they nodded their three old heads, and waited with
amusement in their eyes to see what she would do.
As a matter of fact they had made this particular
bit of muddle in their weaving on purpose that she
might have the pleasure of putting it straight.</p>

<p>But it was a bit of straightening about which
Miss Mason felt a trifle nervous. Her fingers
itched to be at the threads, unravelling and untwisting
the knots, yet somehow she felt a little
frightened to begin.</p>

<p>It was quite three hours before she made up her
mind. Then she suddenly crossed to her writing-table
and wrote a letter to Mr. Davis who had
rooms in Gray&rsquo;s Inn. In the letter she stated that
she wished to see him at eleven o&rsquo;clock precisely
the following morning on urgent business.</p>

<p>And as she folded and sealed the letter the
Three Fates laughed. For Miss Mason had put
her fingers on the first knot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, &ldquo;a most unusual proceeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was twelve o&rsquo;clock on the following morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>He had been talking to Miss Mason for an hour,
or rather she had been talking, and it was the
third time that he had made the above statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Miss Mason firmly, &ldquo;it
is my wish. And I understand that I have absolute
control over my capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolute,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis regretfully, looking
at her with a kind of mild protest through his
spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;have the deeds,
or whatever you call them, drawn up immediately.
I will come down to your office the day after to-morrow
to sign them. I shall bring them away
with me, and post them to you the moment I wish
the matter put in full train. Is everything perfectly
clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis. &ldquo;Of course, if
there had been trustees&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there aren&rsquo;t, thank goodness,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason. &ldquo;Remember, ten o&rsquo;clock Friday morning
I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Davis found himself dismissed; and he left
the studio wondering how a woman who eighteen
months ago did not know how to fill up a cheque
should suddenly have become so remarkably decided
regarding business matters, and utterly refuse
to listen to common-sense statements on his part.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone Miss Mason wrote to
Sara.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My dear Duchessa,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;will you do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>an old woman a favour and come to tea with her
on Friday next at four o&rsquo;clock. I want to see you
on a particular matter. If you are engaged on
Friday will you very kindly appoint some other
hour on which you can come to see me.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="center2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Olive Mason</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>She sent the note by Sally, telling her to wait
for an answer. In half an hour Sally returned
with it. Miss Mason opened it with fingers a little
shaky from anxiety. She read it slowly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;My dear Aunt Olive.&mdash;Thank you for your letter.
I will be with you on Friday next at four
o&rsquo;clock. My love to you and Pippa. I hope you
both enjoyed your holiday in Devonshire.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="center2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sara di Corleone</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It had cost Sara something to write that letter.
It would bring back memories of joy and pain for
her again to enter the courtyard.</p>

<span class="ph3">KNOTS UNTIED</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>N Friday afternoon at half-past two Barnabas
took Pippa to feed the monkeys and other
animals at the Zoological Gardens. It was by
Miss Mason&rsquo;s special request.</p>

<p>During the time that elapsed between their departure
and four o&rsquo;clock Miss Mason was distinctly
restless. She began to sew at some fine white
cambric into which she was putting her most beautiful
stitches. When she had returned from Hope,
Bridget had told her of a Secret that was to arrive
in the spring&mdash;a secret which if it was a boy was
to be called Oliver, but Bridget hoped it would be
Olive. She and Jasper were beamingly happy.</p>

<p>Miss Mason put in a few stitches, but she found
it impossible to sit still. She dropped the work
into a basket, got up from her chair, and began to
walk up and down the room. Then she would suddenly
sit down and begin to sew again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old fool,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can no more
help interfering than I can help breathing, and yet
I&rsquo;m as nervous as a cat.&rdquo; And she began to watch
the clock anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>It had just chimed the hour in its silvery tone
when Sally opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchessa di Corleone,&rdquo; she said. She had
learnt the name by now.</p>

<p>Sara came into the room. She was in a dark
blue dress, and because the day was keen, though
bright, she was wrapped in dark sable furs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;I am quite delighted
to see you. Sally, bring tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara sat down and loosened her furs. Miss Mason
looked at her. Her face was paler than even
its usual worry warranted. It had lost the under-glow
of warmth, and her eyes looked dark and sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good time in Devonshire?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;A few people
grinned fatuously when they saw my old figure
skipping over the rocks. But I said to myself,
&lsquo;The Duchessa wouldn&rsquo;t see anything to laugh at,&rsquo;
and so I didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara smiled. &ldquo;You still remember our conversation
long ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten it,&rdquo; said Miss Mason emphatically.
&ldquo;I fancy if I had not seen you that
evening I should have given up all my dreams and
have gone back to the old house for the rest of my
life. And what a lot I should have missed if I
had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what a lot a great many people would
have missed,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve woven yourself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>into a good many lives. Why, dozens of babies
would have been minus white woolly jackets,
while several bigger babies would have lost a good
deal of happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice of you to say so,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. And
she began to pour out tea.</p>

<p>For the next twenty minutes they talked of little
things&mdash;the visit to Devonshire, the donkey-tour,
the flat Aurora and Alan had taken, and Pippa at
present feeding the animals at the Zoo. Sara
talked lightly and even gaily. As Barnabas had
said, she was a good actress. It was not till the
meal was finished, then Miss Mason spoke on the
subject of her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she then said suddenly, &ldquo;what is
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara flushed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; she said.
She made no attempt at denial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want you to tell me,&rdquo; said Miss
Mason, &ldquo;because I know. But I think I can find
a way out of the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara gave a little sad laugh. &ldquo;If you can you
are clever. I&rsquo;ve thought and thought, and can see
none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason coughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all perfectly simple,
really,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;only I don&rsquo;t quite know how
to begin to tell you. It seems to me that money is
the most difficult thing in the world to talk about.&rdquo;
She took two envelopes from the table. &ldquo;Will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>you, my dear, read the contents of those. It seems
to me the simplest way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara took the envelopes&mdash;long ones&mdash;and
drew out the parchment contents. She read
slowly. At first she could hardly grasp their meaning,
it had been so unexpectedly presented to her.</p>

<p>At last she looked up. Her face was quivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I simply couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, why not?&rdquo; said Miss Mason.
&ldquo;Will you look at the whole thing reasonably. If
I chose to bequeath certain sums of money to you
and Paul at my death I presume you would not
feel it incumbent on you to refuse them. Why
shouldn&rsquo;t you accept them now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Sara again. And she
stopped, looking from the documents she held to
Miss Mason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;that people often
feel a kind of pride about accepting money, though
why on earth they should calmly take it from dead
people and refuse to accept it from living ones, I
can&rsquo;t imagine. Of course their argument might
be that dead people can&rsquo;t use it themselves. That
would be true. But then this special living person
can&rsquo;t use all hers. Let me just put things clearly
to you. I have a capital that brings me in fifteen
thousand a year. Five thousand a year I am devoting
to a certain scheme in which Barnabas is
helping me. I wish to make over sufficient capital
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>to you and Paul to bring you in two thousand five
hundred a year each. That will leave me with five
thousand a year for my own use. My dear, I
don&rsquo;t even spend that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But charities&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Sara vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of them.
If you&rsquo;d written as many charitable letters as I
have you&rsquo;d have had enough of charities. I wrote
hundreds for Miss Stanhope. She always filled in
the amount she gave herself. I never knew what
it was. But I can give to all the charities I want
out of five thousand. Now, my dear, will you
agree. Will you give me the pleasure of your acceptance
and allow me a few more years on this
extremely pleasant planet in which I can see your
happiness, instead of waiting till I&rsquo;m dead and coming
then to drop a few grateful tears and white
flowers on my grave. I&rsquo;d infinitely prefer the
former I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara gave a little half-laughing sob. &ldquo;I accept
with all my heart,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know
how ever I am to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason grunted. &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s another
thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t try. Do think if
you can that the money just happened into the bank
without any human agency. If you&rsquo;re going to
keep an eternal feeling of gratitude before your
mind it will spoil everything. I want to be able to
quarrel with you and Paul and scold you as much
as I like, and if I felt that gratitude was preventing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>you from answering me back it would destroy my
whole pleasure in the proceeding. Besides, my
dear, if there is any debt owing it is I who owe it.
I&rsquo;ve never forgotten the hope you gave me the first
evening we met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara stretched out her hands with a little laugh
of pure happiness. It was the first time she had
laughed like that for three months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I tried to sermonize a little,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;And then we got on to fairy tales, and I was
happier. Oh, isn&rsquo;t life a fairy tale! And if we
told all the dull, prosaic people of the truly delightful
and unexpected things that happen wouldn&rsquo;t
they say that it was all made-up, and far-fetched,
and things like that. When it is just that they are
too stupid to see the happenings, and too heavy and
dull to look over the wall in which they have enclosed
themselves. I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy I
am. And will you think me a pig if I run away
for a little while and tell Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up from her chair, radiant, vital, as she
had been on the day she had first entered the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Miss Mason, &ldquo;if you hadn&rsquo;t
said you were going I should have sent you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sara held out both her hands. &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;as if I were taking it too quietly, and as if I
ought to have protested more. But after everything
you said I really couldn&rsquo;t. It was all so absolutely
true. And we&rsquo;d both so much rather have
you here seeing our happiness in your wonderful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>legacy, than that we should go to a grave to thank
you, and lay that white flower tenderly on the
grass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Mason gave a gruff laugh. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
conceive,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what pleasure you&rsquo;ve given
me.&rdquo; Then quite suddenly she took Sara in her
arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; she said as she released her,
&ldquo;do, for goodness&rsquo; sake, go and make that poor
Paul happy.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="ph3">THE TUNE OF LOVE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>AUL had gone on bravely with his life. He
knew that when Sara had gone out of his studio
into the summer night she had taken something
away with her, the something that was the best
part of himself. But with what remained to him
he had set himself to face the lonely months ahead
of him. Each morning as he woke he told himself
that he would work for her. It was the only thing
that made work possible to him.</p>

<p>His joy in art had been sufficient for him until
he met her. Her coming had increased it ten-thousandfold,
as it had increased his whole joy in
life and in beauty, giving it a meaning he had
never before realized. And when she went she had
taken it away, leaving him with nothing but the
husk.</p>

<p>In spite of his courage, loneliness at times seemed
as if it must overwhelm him, for now it was unlike
his former loneliness. Before, he had not known
what it was to have the perfect companionship of
a woman. Now he had known it and lost it. And
the years before him stretched very grey. He
tried to see a gleam of gold in the future, but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>was too far off for him to perceive it by sight; he
could only tell himself in faith that one day it
would dawn through the greyness. But however
strong the spirit may be to have faith, the flesh
after all is human and weak, and his loneliness
pressed hard upon him. During the last weeks,
too, he had had only one commission&mdash;an uninteresting
one, which he had nevertheless accepted.
He would now, as he had said, have painted anyone
however commonplace. But the work had not
taken him in any degree out of himself.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fourteenth of October
he was sitting alone in his studio. It had been a
bad day for him&mdash;one of the days that come to all
artists when hand and brain alike refuse to work,
when inspiration is lacking, and it seems as if her
light had departed for ever.</p>

<p>He looked round the room. There was rather
a neglected appearance about it. He had given up
his man as an extravagance he could not possibly
afford, and he was on the look-out for a tenant for
his studio, meaning to move into something much
smaller. Yet, in spite of the neglected look of the
studio, Paul himself was as well groomed as ever.
Personal cleanliness was an ingrained characteristic
of him. It belonged to him as much as it belonged
to the French aristocrats who manicured
their nails while waiting in the Bastille for the
tumbrils that would take them to the scaffold and
the embrace of the guillotine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>After a time he got up from his chair, and taking
the kettle from the stove, he made some tea. As
he did so he thought of the many times Sara had
had tea with him since the day in Battersea Park.</p>

<p>Everything he did or thought reminded him of
her. The tiniest and most trivial details recalled
her&mdash;even a thing as insignificant as the crack in
the table. He remembered seeing her run her finger
along it one day when she had been sitting in
the chair opposite to him, which chair was now
empty. The tea-cups reminded him. He had
bought them specially for her. Before that he had
only possessed two cracked ones and a tumbler.
Even one of the cracked ones was precious, because
from it she had drunk a cup of coffee the day
Pippa had lunched with him and he had decided
to re-paint her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Paul to himself, &ldquo;joy was so
near me, and now I must pass, at the best, years of
my life alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked across at the vases on the bookshelf.
They had never held flowers since the day thirteen
weeks ago when they had been full of crimson
roses. They and the blue vase on the mantelpiece,
to the colour of which Pippa had likened Sara,
were covered with dust. Paul felt suddenly as if,
in spite of his efforts, dust were settling on his
heart.</p>

<p>And then all at once he heard a slight sound.
It was a woman&rsquo;s step in the courtyard. Paul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>caught hold of the arm of his chair and gripped it
hard. His face had gone quite white.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

<p>The next moment she was in his arms and he
was sobbing like a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear heart, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sara, her voice
shaking.</p>

<p>He put her in a chair and sat down by the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have come,&rdquo; he said brokenly.</p>

<p>She went over to him and knelt beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dearest, listen,&rdquo; she said, taking both his
hands, &ldquo;I have come to tell you of joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul stared at her half bewildered. &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so wonderful I
can hardly believe it myself. But it&rsquo;s all true&mdash;true&mdash;true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, quickly,&rdquo; said Paul, putting his arms
round her.</p>

<p>And as many weeks ago he had had to tell her
bad news, so she now told him news of joy. She
told him everything, all Miss Mason&rsquo;s quaint and
excellent reasons for their acceptance of this happiness
with no thought of false pride to intervene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will accept, Paul?&rdquo; said Sara, as she finished.</p>

<p>Again the man&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears. &ldquo;Beloved,
I must. My love for you would sweep away
all pride. But I think with a gift offered in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>way one need have none. My God, it&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so she still knelt beside him, and he held her
in a kind of dumb ecstasy, as if he feared to move
and find it was only a dream. And the music of
the Heart which had long held such a throb of
pain now rose loud and glorious, filling the whole
studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beloved,&rdquo; said Paul at last, &ldquo;let us go together
and find Aunt Olive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went out into the purple dusk, in which
a light wind was scattering the last few golden
leaves from the trees, letting them float gently to
the courtyard.</p>

<p>And the little faun saw them coming, and the
tune he played to welcome them was the sweetest,
purest Tune of Love.</p>

<span class="ph3">A WEDDING DAY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND so the knots the Fates had twisted were
unravelled, and the threads re-woven into the
beautiful pattern of joy and gladness, love and
friendship.</p>

<p>One day Paul took Sara down to Hampshire to
see his mother, a white-haired old lady with a wrinkled
face and a peaceful mouth, and eyes like Paul&rsquo;s.
She took Sara at once to her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my boy has had a lonely
life, and I thank God he has found a woman like
you to fill it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Sara in her turn loved the old lady, not
only for Paul&rsquo;s sake, but for her own. And she
loved the little cottage where she lived, and she
loved the old-fashioned garden with its box-edged
paths, and flower-beds in which a few late autumn
flowers still lingered. The rooms in the cottage
were small, but all as dainty and clean as porcelain,
and fragrant with the scent of lavender and
potpourri. She showed Sara the bedrooms with
their old chintz curtains before the casement windows,
and the frilly dressing-tables, and white-valanced
beds. They had each the effect of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>Dresden china Shepherdess&mdash;the tiniest bit stiff,
but extraordinarily dainty. She showed her her
store cupboard with its pots of jam, marmalade,
and pickles, and she promised her a recipe for
curing hams and another for making oat cake.</p>

<p>And Sara told her how to make spaghetti, and
told her it was the first dish she had ever cooked
for Paul. And in the evening when they went
away she took with her a great bunch of Michaelmas
daisies. And Mrs. Treherne kissed her and
blessed her, for she knew that the next day she
was to be Paul&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reception was to be held in Miss Mason&rsquo;s
studio by special request from Paul and Sara.
Sara felt that already the house on the Embankment
was hers no longer.</p>

<p>There were to be few guests at the wedding&mdash;only
the other artists of the courtyard, Bridget,
Christopher, Andrew, and the two executors of
Giuseppe&rsquo;s will, who would bring with them the
important letter whose secret would be at last disclosed.
The journey and the fatigue of the ceremony,
however quiet, would have been too much
for Mrs. Treherne. Sara&rsquo;s own father and mother
had been dead several years. Christopher was to
give away the bride, and Barnabas was to be best
man.</p>

<p>And so the day dawned, a still, November day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>of soft mists and a pale blue sky&mdash;a tender day
full of peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Christopher went to the house on the Embankment
to fetch Sara. She was waiting in the drawing-room
for him, in a sapphire-blue dress, a large
black hat, and her soft sable furs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; said Christopher, smiling. And they
went down the stairs together.</p>

<p>Pietro was in the hall. His face was radiant
with pleasure. Paul and Sara had arranged to
keep him in their service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you know
when we return to London. You will of course
hand over the keys of the house to the executors
when they ask for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Grace. Good fortune and happiness
to your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pietro,&rdquo; said Sara. And then she
passed through the door he held open for her, and
went down the steps to the taxi, Christopher following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; said Sara a moment or two after
they had started, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been a very good friend
to me, and I&rsquo;d like to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No occasion to do so,&rdquo; said Christopher imperturbably.
&ldquo;The friendship has been mutual,
and I hope will still continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;That was one thing
I wanted to say to you. My love for Paul doesn&rsquo;t
make the least difference in my friendship for you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>You will be exactly the same to me, as I shall be,
I hope, to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Christopher, holding out his
hand with a smile. But he knew that it never
would be quite the same again. Her marriage with
Guiseppe had made no difference, her marriage
with Paul would. And with the knowledge Christopher
had suddenly realized what he was losing.
He was like a man who had had a jewel in a box,
looking at it always in one position, and it was not
till he took it in his hand to give it to another that
it suddenly flashed upon him in a new light, and
he saw colours and depths in it hitherto unperceived,
and a longing to keep it took possession of
him. But the deed was already virtually signed
and witnessed, the power to keep it lost, and so he
hid what he was feeling, and his manner towards
her held nothing but his old courtliness, his old
friendship. The pain the new knowledge had
brought him must be his alone.</p>

<p>And as the taxi stopped at the door of the church
he helped Sara to alight, and gave her his arm to
lead her up the steps, and up the aisle to the other
man who was waiting for her.</p>

<span class="ph3">A GIFT FROM THE DEAD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>IGNOR Bernardo Cignolesi took his
watch from his pocket and looked at Signor
Manfredi Guido.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, I think, the exact hour,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>They were small and dapper Italians, these two,
who had been appointed by the late Duca di Corleone
as the executors of his will and the keepers
of the letter.</p>

<p>The whole party was assembled in Miss Mason&rsquo;s
studio. The wedding was over. Paul and Sara
had plighted their troth. The blessing upon them
had been pronounced. And when the last words
of it had died away the church had been suddenly
filled with music, the notes of a violin joyous and
sweet, a wedding song for the two, a song that had
never before been played.</p>

<p>It was Michael&rsquo;s tribute to them both. The
organist alone had been taken into the secret, and
the man, who was a very true musician, listened to
the song with his eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Michael,&rdquo; Sara had whispered. And no
one had moved till the music had ceased.</p>

<p>But now they were all in the studio, eating wedding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>cake and drinking champagne, which Pippa
had never tasted before and which made her gasp.
She was wearing a little pendant Paul had given
her. It was gold and shaped like a tulip, and it
held in its chalice a blue sapphire.</p>

<p>And it was exactly an hour from the time the
blessing had been pronounced that Signor Bernardo
Cignolesi said to Signor Manfredi Guido:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is the exact hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Signor Manfredi Guido took a sealed envelope
from his pocket, and holding it in his hand
the two crossed together to Sara, who was standing
by Paul, her radiance and magnetism filling the
whole place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow us,&rdquo; said Signor Guido, speaking for
himself and his co-executor, &ldquo;to give into your
possession the letter addressed to you by the late
Duca di Corleone. And now permit me to kiss
your hand and wish you all happiness, thanking
you at the same time for your hospitality.&rdquo; He
raised her hand to his lips, and Signor Cignolesi
followed his example. Then bowing and smiling
the two dapper little men returned to their glasses
of champagne.</p>

<p>Sara broke the seal of the envelope and drew out
the paper it contained. It was a letter in the late
Duca&rsquo;s handwriting, and addressed to herself.</p>

<p>She crossed slowly to Miss Mason&rsquo;s large oak
chair and sat down while she read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; the letter began, &ldquo;if ever you read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>this letter it will be on the day that you have given
yourself into the keeping of the man you love.
Therefore, will you permit me, from the regions of
the peaceful dead, to offer to you my felicitations?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is possible that since my death there have
been moments when you have thought of me, if
not with anger, at least with vexation. I knew I
ran the risk of incurring this sentiment on your
part when I drew up my will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I now give you my reasons and my excuse
for my action? I will be as brief as possible:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you married me, my dear, you were able
to bring me a certain quiet affection, a very true
courtliness, and an entire faithfulness. Love had
not entered your life. You did not, then, know its
meaning. I was not the man to teach you. I
knew it, and yet I was selfish enough to take you.
My excuse is simply that I loved you. You gave
me what you had then to give, and it made me
happy. If I longed for more I knew it was not
withheld, but simply, at the time, non-existent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I realized, however, what one day you would
have it in your power to give. And knowing that,
I determined that the best should come to you and
be asked of you. Hence my will. Total surrender
of all worldly possessions for love. Love seeking
you for your sake alone. My dear, was I
wrong? I may have been. I leave it now for you
to judge me. I wanted you, because I loved you,
to have the gift of love in your life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that you have it I, from the quiet
regions to which I shall have attained, send my
offering to you and the man of your choice.
Signor Cignolesi will give you another packet. In
it you will find a deed leaving you the whole and
sole possessor of the Casa di Corleone on the banks
of Lake Como.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You loved it, and I loved to see you there. If
the spirits of the departed are allowed to return to
earth, mine will come there to see you in your happiness.
And remember, my dear, that in it I shall
rejoice, for I believe that the only thing that could
mar the peace to which, please God, I shall attain,
would be your sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, my dear, live joyously in the Casa di Corleone. And when
on sunny days you sit in the shadow of the orange trees, and your children
come running to you across the courtyard,
God grant that my spirit may be there to see
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may His Blessing be upon you; and the
Blessed Virgin and all the Saints have you in their
keeping,</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Giuseppe di Corleone.</span>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Sara looked up. Her eyes were misty. She
signed to Paul to come to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Giuseppe was a generous
man, and a very true courtier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Paul had read it he kissed Sara&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>hand. Then he came back to the table and every
one saw that he had something to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;has just received
a gift from one who we know is at peace. It is
the gift of a home she loves&mdash;the Casa di Corleone.
And the offering comes from the Duca di Corleone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed his head gravely, as did all the other
occupants of the studio, while Sara, Pippa, Barnabas,
and the two dapper little Italians, made the sign
of the cross. And so they all for a moment paid
tribute to the memory of a true and generous man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, of course, came a babel of congratulations,
and Paul was called upon for a speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speeches,&rdquo; said Paul smiling, &ldquo;are not very
much in my line. My wife and I thank you all very
much for being here to-day, and we know that
throughout our lives we can count on the true friendship
of all present. There is one toast, ladies and
gentlemen, I would like to propose. It is to one
who has been, and is, the best friend of many of
us. Ladies and gentlemen let us drink to Aunt
Olive in Bohemia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And everybody got to their feet, and there was
a good deal of applause, and a good deal of laughter,
but the eyes of some of them were a little dim,
as were the eyes of the old lady who sat there smiling,
and thanking God in her heart for His wonderful
gifts of Love and Happiness.</p>

<span class="ph3">THE MUSIC OF TWO COURTYARDS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND so it was that Paul and Sara did not spend
their honeymoon in Paris as they had at first
intended, but travelled direct through without stopping
to the Casa di Corleone on the banks of Lake
Como.</p>

<p>It was in the purple and crimson of a sunset that
Paul first saw the courtyard, and the golden
oranges among their dark green leaves, and the
marble fauns and nymphs, and heard the plashing
of the fountain. The crimson light from the sky
was touching the white marble of the figures, transforming
them momentarily to the warm flush of life.
Sara and Paul passed between them and up the steps
of the old house into the great hall where the smiling
Italian servants were ready to greet them, and where
from the gallery above the haughty ladies of the
house of Corleone looked down upon the two, and
where from among them the portrait of the now true
owner of the place glowed like a great blue sapphire.</p>

<p>And a couple of hours later they came into the
dining-room, where shaded lamps filled the place
with a soft mellow light, and shed their glow on the
white damask cloth, on the shining glass and silver,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>on decanters of red wine, and on dishes of golden
oranges. Soft-footed low-voiced servants waited
on them. It was a magic scene, over which the
gods of Love and Joy reigned supreme.</p>

<p>And later still, the moon rose in the night sky,
bathing the lake in silver, touching the marble
statues to unearthly whiteness, and finding its way
through a great window where two figures stood together
looking at its light upon the sleeping lake.
Behind them the room was full of flickering lights
and shadows from a fire of fir-cones burning on the
hearth.</p>

<p>And at last Sara turned from the strange beauty
of the scene, and saw Paul&rsquo;s eyes upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;content?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beloved of my heart,&rdquo; he said, and his arms
closed round her.</p>

<p>And so the Music of the Heart again filled the
room, playing in glorious and most perfect harmony
for the two whom the Gods had blessed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And far away in England, in a studio in another
courtyard, Aunt Olive was putting a question to
Barnabas, while Pippa was lying asleep in the
inner room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that Paul and Sara will have reached the
Casa di Corleone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Alan and Aurora
are cooing together, and Jasper and Bridget have
found happiness, I wonder what is going to become
of you and Dan and Michael.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to wind us up tidily, too,&rdquo; said
Barnabas, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;Michael has his music
and his drawing, and, at last, an ideal which will
be his throughout his life. Dan will always be
what he is now&mdash;big, silent, making harmless love
to all women (he has been flirting disgracefully
with Bridget, and Jasper has been quite refreshingly
jealous), and always he will be a staunch friend
of those who need him. And I, for the next few
years, will turn my whole attention to your candidates
for the School of a Wonderful Chance, and
later&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And later?&rdquo; asked Aunt Olive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And later,&rdquo; said Barnabas, &ldquo;I hope to ask you
for Pippa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And through the half-open window the little
faun heard the words. And under the stars he
piped a tune of the fairy tale of life, a tune of love
and laughter, whose notes reached the soul of the
sculptor who had fashioned him, and hearing the
music he was glad.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
